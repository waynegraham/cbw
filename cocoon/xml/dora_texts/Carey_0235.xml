hurrying to and fro on the mighty ant-hill of existence, <lb/>
each bent on his or her <anchor corresp="life_events death" type="" subtype="" id="carey_" />little fraction of business, there <lb/>
sometimes emerges from the shifting crowd some strong, <lb/>
distinct personality whose influence makes itself felt from <lb/>
the first, and who, by sheer force of will, seems to dominate <lb/>
and hold sway over its fellows. To feeble, mediocre <lb/>
characters there is nothing so alarming as undivided <reg orig="re-|sponsibility">responsibility</reg>; <lb/>
only those who are born in the purple know <lb/>
how to fill a throne. Human nature has its aristocracy and <lb/>
its democracy, its regality and kingship, and its proletariat, <lb/>
its hewers of wood and drawers of water, homely and <lb/>
plebeian. The leaders of men, the workers who have made <lb/>
their mark in their generation, and whose name is still <lb/>
handed down to us for reverence and admiration, at one <lb/>
time or other in their lives have stood alone; on their way <lb/>
to their promised land they have not feared to cross the <lb/>
wilderness, and to endure, if needs be, their forty years of <lb/>
wandering and unrest. "The end crowns all," that is their <lb/>
<pb n="216"/>
motto; and when they take possession of their inheritance <lb/>
they bear the travel-stains of the pilgrim and the scars of <lb/>
the warrior; greatness is theirs, but they have suffered its <lb/>
pains and penalties, and have not grudged to pay the price.</p>
<p>In considering the noted women of the Victorian era, <lb/>
there is no more fascinating personality than Dorothy <lb/>
pattison, the beloved Sister Dora of Walsall, once described <lb/>
by one who knew her as "Our Pandora," unto whom the <lb/>
great God had given all precious gifts, besides an infinite <lb/>
hope, and "without the mischiefs."</p>
<p>There is profound truth in this eulogium, nevertheless. <lb/>
Dorothy Pattison's character was a strangely complex one&mdash; <lb/>
she was intensely human, and human nature is by no means <lb/>
perfect. In spite of her large heart, her deep womanly <lb/>
tenderness, her pure, sound nature, she yet made grievous <lb/>
mistakes in her life, which cost her anguish and bitter tears, <lb/>
and the very force of her strong will led her into error. She <lb/>
was very humble in her own estimate of herself. "I look <lb/>
back on my life and see 'nothing but leaves,'" she writes <lb/>
when lying on her death-bed, spent and worn with <reg orig="super-|human">superhuman</reg> <lb/>
labours for her suffering fellow-creatures&mdash;"nothing <lb/>
but leaves"; no one who knew Sister Dora would have <lb/>
endorsed that.</p>
<p>Dorothy Wyndham Pattison was born in the village of <lb/>
Hauxwell, near Richmond, in the North Riding of Yorkshire. <lb/>
Her father, the Rev. Mark James Pattison, was the rector of <lb/>
Hauxwell; he belonged to a Devonshire family. Dorothy <lb/>
was the youngest but one of twelve children; she inherited <lb/>
her beauty from her mother, and her finely proportioned <lb/>
figure from her father.</p>
<p>Miss Lonsdale, in her Life of Sister Dora, gives us a <lb/>
description of the place where she spent her childhood. <lb/>
"Hauxwell," she writes, "is a tiny village lying on the <lb/>
southern slope of a hill, from whence an extensive view of <lb/>
the moors and Wensleydale is obtained. It contains between <lb/>
<pb n="217"/>
two and three hundred inhabitants. The rectory is a pretty <lb/>
little dwelling, some half-mile from the church, which is a <lb/>
fine old building much shut in by trees. The whole village, <lb/>
even on a bright summer day, gives the traveller an impression <lb/>
of intense quiet, if not dulness; but in winter, when the <lb/>
snow lies thickly for weeks together in the narrow lane, the <lb/>
only thoroughfare of the place, when the distant moors look <lb/>
cold in their garment of white, and the large expanse of sky <lb/>
is covered with leaden-coloured clouds, when the very <lb/>
streams with which the country abounds are frozen into <lb/>
silence&mdash;then, indeed, may Hauxwell be called a lonely <lb/>
village."</p>
<p>Dorothy appears to have been a very delicate child, and <lb/>
much petted by her sisters. She was not allowed to learn <lb/>
much on account of her weak health; but her mind was <lb/>
vigorous, and she seemed to pick up crumbs of information <lb/>
almost instinctively. Even in early childhood she observed <lb/>
things minutely, and stored up in her memory the results of <lb/>
her observations. She very soon showed a great <reg orig="determina-|tion">determination</reg> <lb/>
to have her own way; but though wilful, she was not <lb/>
passionate, and her disposition was affectionate and unselfish.</p>
<p>"If she could not get her own way easily," we read, "she <lb/>
did not give it up or take refuge in sulks, or in an outbreak <lb/>
of temper, like most children; rather the meeting with <lb/>
opposition seemed to stimulate her active mind to find a <lb/>
device for getting her way back." There is an amusing <lb/>
anecdote told in illustration of this, of how Dorothy and her <lb/>
next sister tried to spoil some obnoxious velvet bonnets by <lb/>
putting their heads out of window one rainy day, and then <lb/>
laying them in their boxes soaking wet. "Quite spoilt: we <lb/>
can never wear them any more," was her answer when <lb/>
questioned about the bonnets; but, to their chagrin, the little <lb/>
culprits were condemned to wear them for many Sundays.</p>
<p>When Dorothy was fourteen she had a severe illness, <lb/>
accompanied by terrible spasms, and it was then she learnt <lb/>
<pb n="218"/>
to bear pain with such fortitude, "combined with an aptitude <lb/>
for always looking on the bright side of everything&mdash;a habit <lb/>
which never forsook her through life." After this her health <lb/>
began to improve.</p>
<p>The Pattison family were devoted to the village people. <lb/>
The girls would plan how to save their money, that they <lb/>
might give it away; they would mend their old dresses to <lb/>
avoid buying new ones, and give away their dinner and <lb/>
dine on bread and cheese. To give was a delight to them, <lb/>
and Dorothy shared their devotion to the poor. A boy <lb/>
who had fallen ill of rheumatic fever during her absence <lb/>
abroad, longed incessantly to see "Miss Dora" again before <lb/>
he died. On her return she went to him at once, and <lb/>
nursed him till he died. This seems to have been the only <lb/>
instance of her nursing sick people in early youth; her <lb/>
chief work at that time was training the village choir. She <lb/>
had a clear, powerful voice, with a love for music. As her <lb/>
health grew stronger she was also a daring horsewoman; she <lb/>
loved to follow the hounds, and go to meets with her <lb/>
brothers. She often described to her patients in after years <lb/>
her rides across the wild moorlands. She was also fond of <lb/>
driving herself in a pony carriage, and enjoyed running, <lb/>
jumping, and playing games.</p>
<p>By the time she was twenty Dora, as she was now called, <lb/>
had become tall and strong, full of restless, untiring energy <lb/>
that never allowed her to be inactive for a minute, and with <lb/>
a flow of bright, natural spirits. One neighbour writes, <lb/>
"Her merry laugh is still in my ears"; and another spoke <lb/>
of her "as a bright bonnie maiden singing about the house." <lb/>
Her personal beauty was remarkable; "her features were <lb/>
almost perfect; her white teeth and brilliant dark-brown <lb/>
eyes set widely apart and twinkling with merry sympathy," <lb/>
were some of her attractions, and also her small, beautifully <lb/>
shaped hands. "Perhaps later on in life," writes Miss <lb/>
Lonsdale, "the powerful form of her chin and jaw, <reg orig="remind-|ing">reminding</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="219"/>
one of Dante's profile, became too marked for beauty. <lb/>
At the age of twenty, however, the dark, lightly curling hair <lb/>
waving all over her head, which no amount of cutting off <lb/>
or covering with caps could ever smooth, the softness and <lb/>
roundness of youth, the extreme beauty of her whole <lb/>
colouring and complexion, made her a fascinating creature <lb/>
to look upon."</p>
<p>A country life did not satisfy Dora; her sympathies were <lb/>
roused by Miss Nightingale's work in Scutari, and she begged <lb/>
her father to allow her to join her band of nurses. This <lb/>
request was refused. He pointed out to her that she was <lb/>
wholly untrained and undisciplined, and that she had enough <lb/>
to employ her at home; and though she chafed secretly <lb/>
under the disappointment, she still did her home duties <lb/>
cheerfully. Her mother was an invalid, and she did much <lb/>
of the nursing, and her father called her "his sunshine." <lb/>
Sister Dora always believed in presentiments. During <lb/>
a visit to her brother she had a dream. She thought <lb/>
her mother stood beside her bed, and called, "Dora, Dora, <lb/>
Dora!" It left such a vivid impression on her mind that <lb/>
she told her old servant about it. The next night the dream <lb/>
returned, and Dora was convinced that her mother was in <lb/>
danger and wanted her. Her brother tried to laugh her out <lb/>
of the intention of sending to the neighbouring town for <lb/>
letters; but she persisted in doing so, and a letter which <lb/>
had been delayed three days was found, telling her of her <lb/>
mother's dangerous illness. She returned home at once, <lb/>
and found her on her deathbed. She died soon after. <lb/>
Dora was now deprived of her chief home occupation; <lb/>
her mother's death and other circumstances increased her <lb/>
longing for an active life.</p>
<p>During her visits to Redcar she became acquainted with <lb/>
some of the members of a large working Sisterhood calling <lb/>
themselves "the Good Samaritans," whose headquarters <lb/>
were at Coatham, where they had a convalescent home.</p>
<pb n="220"/>
<p>As her quiet life grew more distasteful to her, she began to <lb/>
think these Sisters were to be envied. Her father <reg orig="dis-|approved">disapproved</reg> <lb/>
of her leaving home for other work, though he <lb/>
would not actually forbid it. Dora was nine-and-twenty, <lb/>
and certainly old enough to know her own mind. "I was <lb/>
very wilful; I did very wrong; let no one take me for an <lb/>
example," were her words on her deathbed, as though the <lb/>
memory of her waywardness had burdened her conscience <lb/>
through life. Her strong will prevailed, and in October <lb/>
1861 Dora left Hauxwell Rectory, and became nominally <lb/>
village schoolmistress in the parish of Woolston, near <lb/>
Bletchley, on the borders of Buckingham. Her father <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg> <lb/>
her allowance. This and the small salary belonging <lb/>
to her office was all she had to live upon. She had a small <lb/>
cottage, kept no servant, only an old woman came in now <lb/>
and then do the scrubbing; but she seemed to have spent <lb/>
three years happily enough. Her beauty and highly-bred <lb/>
appearance soon excited interest in the neighbourhood, and <lb/>
her devotion to children made her popular. She visited <lb/>
them in their homes, and nursed them when they were ill. <lb/>
At times her loneliness must have tried her, and once she <lb/>
had an unpleasant experience with burglars who made off <lb/>
with her silver spoons and forks.</p>
<p>At the end of three years her health suffered. A neglected <lb/>
cold resulted in a severe attack of pleurisy, and when fit to <lb/>
be moved she was sent to Redcar for change. The old <lb/>
associations connected with the place revived, and in the <lb/>
autumn of 1864 she joined the Sisterhood of the "Good <lb/>
Samaritans" in spite of the disapproval of her family. It <lb/>
was impossible for those who knew her best to acquiesce <lb/>
in this step. They were too well aware that she was <lb/>
singularly unfitted for a Sister's life. The atmosphere was <lb/>
too restricted; and though she was soon very popular, <lb/>
there was no denying that she disliked the sole society of <lb/>
women, and somewhat despised their limited physical <lb/>
<pb n="221"/>
power. Her intellectual gifts and "pride of life," and her <lb/>
keen sense of humour, were likely to be snares to her.</p>
<p>But there were other reasons that were urging her to <lb/>
work&mdash;a profound restlessness and mental dissatisfaction. <lb/>
We read "that before she went to Woolston she fell under <lb/>
the influence of an intellect more powerful than her own, <lb/>
and the result of her contact with it was a shock to the very <lb/>
foundations of her religious faith.&hellip; Her mind was filled <lb/>
with doubts relating to the authenticity and inspiration of <lb/>
the Holy Scriptures, so that she could not give herself up to <lb/>
that personal devotion to Christ, without which her nature <lb/>
could not be satisfied."</p>
<p>The Sisterhood of the Good Samaritans was a secular <lb/>
community, and the members took no vows except that <lb/>
of obedience to the Mother Superior and the clergyman. <lb/>
Sister Dora's training was very distasteful to her; she <lb/>
made beds, scoured floors and grates, and finally became <lb/>
cook at Coatham. She actually sat down and cried one <lb/>
day when the beds she had made were pulled to pieces <lb/>
by some one in authority, and she had to remake them.</p>
<p>Her first attempts at nursing were made in the Cottage <lb/>
Hospital at North Annesley, near Middlesbrough, where <lb/>
she worked sometimes alone or with other Sisters.</p>
<p>In the early part of 1865 Sister Dora was sent to Walsall, <lb/>
to a small cottage hospital, which had been established <lb/>
the year before and was in charge of the Good Samaritan <lb/>
Sisterhood. Walsall was a town at that time containing <lb/>
about thirty-five thousand inhabitants, on the borders of the <lb/>
great coal and iron district in South Staffordshire called <lb/>
"The Black Country." There is a vivid description of <lb/>
Walsall in Sister Dora's "Life." One seems to see the <lb/>
forests of tall chimneys belching out smoke and flame, <lb/>
the "rows of dusky little red-brick houses, the huge cranes <lb/>
and dirty canals," which are so strangely transfigured and <lb/>
glorified at sunrise and sunset. At night, we read, "the <lb/>
<pb n="222"/>
spectator seems to be transported into the infernal regions, <lb/>
where the blinding glare of blast furnaces, the snorting <lb/>
of engines, the ponderous thud of steam hammers, and the <lb/>
clang and whiz and whirr of machinery, sounds that never <lb/>
cease and which are less noticed during the day, bewilder <lb/>
the senses."</p>
<p>The Birmingham hospitals were seven miles away, and <lb/>
as accidents were becoming frequent, it was necessary to <lb/>
have an accident hospital in Walsall. At first there were <lb/>
only four beds, but before the first twelve months had <lb/>
passed there were fourteen. The Sister in charge had <lb/>
fallen ill, and Sister Dora took her place. Unfortunately <lb/>
she soon after caught small-pox from one of the out-patients, <lb/>
and was very ill; in her delirium she occupied herself in <lb/>
tearing up her sheets into bandages. As soon as she <lb/>
recovered she resumed her nursing.</p>
<p>The Walsall people were rough and ignorant, and at first <lb/>
there was a good deal of prejudice against the Sisters, <lb/>
which gradually died out. Once, as Sister Dora was walking <lb/>
through the town late in the evening, a boy called out: <lb/>
"There goes one of those Sisters of Misery," and threw <lb/>
a stone which cut open her forehead. This young fellow <lb/>
was afterwards brought to the hospital much injured, and <lb/>
was tenderly nursed by Sister Dora. One night she <lb/>
found him crying, and when she asked him what was <lb/>
the matter, he said, with a sob, "Sister, I threw that <lb/>
stone at you." To his astonishment she told him that <lb/>
she had recognised him the moment he had been brought <lb/>
in. "It was his first practical experience of good returned <lb/>
for evil," observed Sister Dora, "and he did not know <lb/>
what to make of it."</p>
<p>She was recalled to Coatham in 1865. Sister Dora's <lb/>
irrepressible flow of spirits sometimes carried her away; <lb/>
once, for example, when she insisted on mounting a donkey <lb/>
renowned for his trick of kicking his rider off: the result <lb/>
<pb n="223"/>
was she fell on her knees, which were so bruised and <lb/>
swollen that she could not kneel without pain for weeks <lb/>
afterwards, but she dare not confess the cause of her <lb/>
suffering. Not long after this the celebrated physician, <lb/>
Sir James Simpson, came to the Home to find a Sister who <lb/>
would take charge of a lady who was nearly insane. His <lb/>
choice fell on Sister Dora. She was making a pudding <lb/>
with her sleeves tucked up when he saw her, and he said <lb/>
at once: "Send me that Sister; she is the one for my case."</p>
<p>The new patient lived near Coatham. Sister Dora had <lb/>
to sit up with her at night and return to the Home to sleep. <lb/>
From her own account it was not a pleasant berth: "An <lb/>
uncommonly unpleasant time I used to have of it," she <lb/>
would say; "what with the mad old lady who was fond <lb/>
of me, with the relations who were jealous of me, and with <lb/>
the flunkey who, because I had my breakfast in the <lb/>
housekeeper's room, took me for a servant, paying me <lb/>
attentions, and making love to me after the manner of his <lb/>
kind, by getting me good things to eat."</p>
<p>Sister Dora had one sensational experience, when her <lb/>
half-crazy patient, angry because her nurse would not accept <lb/>
some valuable jewellery, suddenly sprang out of bed and <lb/>
brandished a long knife over her head. As Sister Dora <lb/>
looked at her calmly she laid it aside, only saying, "I <lb/>
wanted to see if I could frighten you." After this Sister <lb/>
Dora always accepted the gifts, and then gave them up <lb/>
to the relatives the next day.</p>
<p>In November Sister Dora was again sent to Walsall, and <lb/>
though from time to time she went back to Coatham, her <lb/>
hospital work began steadily, and in spite of her want of <lb/>
training she impressed the medical men, with a sense of her <lb/>
fitness. Towards the middle of December she was ordered <lb/>
to nurse a private case in Devonshire; before final <reg orig="arrange-|ments">arrangements</reg> <lb/>
were made she received a letter from home telling <lb/>
her that her father was dangerously ill and wished to see <lb/>
<pb n="224"/>
her. She telegraphed to the Home for permission to go to <lb/>
Hauxwell, and received the unfeeling answer, "No, you <lb/>
must go to Devonshire at once."</p>
<p>The order seems almost incredible, yet Sister Dora with a <lb/>
mistaken sense of duty set off to Devonshire; but she had <lb/>
scarcely reached her destination before she received the <lb/>
tidings of her father's death. She was almost broken-hearted, <lb/>
and when the Mother Superior gave her permission to <lb/>
attend the funeral she refused to go. From this moment <lb/>
a breach commenced between her and Coatham, which <lb/>
widened as the years went on.</p>
<p>No wonder that in her sorrow Sister Dora plunged eagerly <lb/>
into work when she returned to Walsall. She was very <lb/>
ignorant, and her great ambition was to become a good <lb/>
surgical nurse. The in-patients were mostly men and boys <lb/>
disabled by coal-pit accidents or wounded by machinery, <lb/>
while a large number of out-patients&mdash;men, women and <lb/>
children&mdash;visited the hospital daily for medical advice or for <lb/>
the treatment of injuries. The old doctor who was attached <lb/>
to the hospital soon found out for himself that Sister Dora <lb/>
had more coolness, courage, and common sense than most <lb/>
women possessed, and he taught her a great deal. She was <lb/>
allowed to set simple fractures under his superintendence, <lb/>
and then, as he discovered the remarkable delicacy of her <lb/>
touch, he began to teach her the position of the arteries <lb/>
in the human body. No doubt her apprenticeship must <lb/>
have been tolerably severe, as hospital nursing entails <lb/>
constant strain and fatigue.</p>
<p>Just before she left Coatham she had received an offer of <lb/>
marriage; but though she was for some time undecided <lb/>
whether to accept it or not, her affections were not deeply <lb/>
engaged, and she finally resolved not to leave her work.</p>
<p>Her natural instincts inclined her strongly to the ordinary <lb/>
lot of women. Her love for children amounted to a passion, <lb/>
and she never ceased to regret that she would never have <lb/>
<pb n="225"/>
children of her own. Later in life she was heard to say, "If <lb/>
I had to begin life over again I would marry, because a <lb/>
woman ought to live with a man and be in subjection."</p>
<p>In early life she thought differently, and though her <lb/>
friends told her that she was throwing herself away, that <lb/>
her rare talents were wasted, and that she was admirably <lb/>
fitted for domestic life, her strong will was not to be <lb/>
coerced. Her reserve prevented her from disclosing her <lb/>
real reasons; but she herself felt "that her only hope of <lb/>
gaining light in her period of darkness lay in active work <lb/>
for the good of others"; so, to use the words of one who <lb/>
helped her in her difficulties, "she threw into her work <lb/>
at Walsall great powers of mind, strong enthusiasm and <lb/>
wonderful imagination."</p>
<p>Her main stumbling-block was the acuteness of her <reg orig="intel-|lect">intellect</reg>. <lb/>
When she was able to receive historical Christianity, <lb/>
her personal devotion to her Divine Master seemed almost <lb/>
to overwhelm her, and no self-sacrifice seemed too great. <lb/>
The wise counsels of a friend restrained her impetuosity, <lb/>
and prevented her from taking binding vows and entering <lb/>
a strict Sisterhood. He pointed out to her, that her special <lb/>
calling was active service, and that her work exactly suited <lb/>
her. Happily she took his advice, and commenoed her <lb/>
work in a quiet, unobtrusive way, nursing not only in the <lb/>
hospital, but poor creatures in the slums and alleys who were <lb/>
too wretched to present themselves at the hospital.</p>
<p>In 1866 she had a serious illness brought on by exposure <lb/>
and neglect of ordinary precautions. She would come <lb/>
home soaked through, to find a crowd of out-patients <reg orig="await-|ing">awaiting</reg> <lb/>
her; wet clothes were constantly forgotten and allowed <lb/>
to dry on her. She did this once too often. After two or <lb/>
three weeks she was dangerously ill.</p>
<p>A clergyman who visited her constantly during her <reg orig="ill-|ness">illness</reg> <lb/>
was amazed at the fortitude with which she bore <lb/>
pain. She had asked him to wait a moment before he <lb/>
<pb n="226"/>
commenced to read. He related how "she turned away her <lb/>
face which was smiling, beautiful as he thought he had never <lb/>
seen a human face before; and his daughter, who was on <lb/>
the other side of the bed, was shocked to see it suddenly <lb/>
convulsed, as if with sharp agony, the tears streaming down <lb/>
the cheeks and the hands clutching convulsively at the <reg orig="bed-|clothes">bedclothes</reg>. <lb/>
In a moment she turned back calmly to him and <lb/>
said, 'Go on.'"</p>
<p>Sister Dora always expressed her strong belief that her <lb/>
recovery from this illness was due to the prayers of the <lb/>
congregation at St. James, Wednesbury. The incumbent of <lb/>
this church was the Rev. Richard Twigg, of whom it was <lb/>
said that he had "buried talents which would have won the <lb/>
admiration of the world in the smokiest dens of the Black <lb/>
Country." Sister Dora owed much to his teaching and <lb/>
influence, "and his was the main human support to which <lb/>
she consistently clung throughout her life."</p>
<p>In 1867 it was evident that the cottage hospital was <lb/>
inadequate to the needs of Walsall. Its situation did not <lb/>
admit of free ventilation. Fatal erysipelas broke out, and one <lb/>
man was under treatment for six months, but when an <reg orig="ampu-|tation">amputation</reg> <lb/>
case was sent out unhealed the authorities felt it had <lb/>
received its deathblow, and it was resolved to build a new <lb/>
hospital on a larger scale in a better situation. The town <lb/>
of Walsall stands on a steep hill. There was an open space <lb/>
covered with blackened grass sloping up to a second brow of <lb/>
the same hill called the Mount, where the church was; and <lb/>
here the new hospital was built. It contained twenty-eight <lb/>
beds, and three wards, and was so arranged that it was just <lb/>
possible for one person of Sister Dora's calibre to do the <lb/>
entire nursing.</p>
<p>The out-patient department was, however, too small for <lb/>
the numbers who crowded into it, and was unconnected with <lb/>
the main building. "This defect was remedied by Sister <lb/>
Dora herself, who devised a plan to connect it with the <lb/>
<pb n="227"/>
hospital by a glass passage, which she converted into a <lb/>
greenhouse."</p>
<p>A kitchen garden and a green lawn surrounded the <lb/>
building, and in spite of the exposed situation trees and <lb/>
shrubs flourished. From the windows there was a prospect <lb/>
of chimneys and machinery, and a wide extent of sky <lb/>
beyond. As the line of the South Staffordshire railroad <lb/>
ran at the bottom of the hill the patients had plenty of <lb/>
amusement.</p>
<p>About this time small-pox broke out in Walsall and <lb/>
lingered on for several months. Sister Dora did all she <lb/>
could for the sufferers. Whenever she could snatch an hour <lb/>
she visited the sick people in their own homes, and <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg> <lb/>
sat up whole nights with dying patients who had been <lb/>
deserted by their friends. She had no terror of infection, <lb/>
and would dress the wounds of out-patients who had the <lb/>
small-pox out on them; and it has been thought by some <lb/>
that her recklessness about her own safety was in a great <lb/>
measure caused by her secret grief at her father's death, <lb/>
and her remorse at the course she had taken.</p>
<p>There is one story told in her memoir that reads like one <lb/>
belonging to a medi&aelig;val saint, and which would have been <lb/>
worthy of St. Francis of Assisi, or St. Vincent de Paul, and <lb/>
which proves, not only her deep pity and love for suffering <lb/>
humanity, but also her wonderful nerve and heroic <reg orig="endur-|ance">endurance</reg>. <lb/>
A poor man dying of "black-pox," who was much <lb/>
attached to her, sent for her one night. There was only a <lb/>
small piece of candle in the house, and she asked a neighbour <lb/>
who was with him to buy her some more, but the woman <lb/>
never returned. All at once the dying man raised himself <lb/>
and asked her to kiss him before he died; and, loathsome <lb/>
as he was with the horrible disease, she took the poor <lb/>
creature in her arms and kissed him, then, as the candle <lb/>
went out, she sat beside him in the darkness, not knowing if <lb/>
he were alive or dead, till the faint dawn allowed her to <lb/>
<pb n="228"/>
grope her way to the door. It was an ordeal that few <lb/>
women, however brave or good, could have endured.</p>
<p>An old servant of the Pattison family had come to help <lb/>
her at Walsall. She looked after the two servants, kept the <lb/>
hospital linen, and assisted her in many ways; she even <lb/>
learnt to dress wounds, and sometimes sat up with a patient.</p>
<p>Sister Dora's sympathy was often excited by the misery of <lb/>
the poor men who had to submit to amputation; many of <lb/>
them would have preferred death. One day a young man <lb/>
was brought to the hospital with his arm so torn and twisted <lb/>
by a machine that the doctor said he must amputate it at once. <lb/>
Sister Dora's heart was wrung at the poor fellow's despair. <lb/>
She looked at the torn limb, and then at the stalwart, healthy <lb/>
form of the young man, then she turned to the surgeon and <lb/>
told him quietly that she believed that she could save the <lb/>
arm if he would permit her to try. The doctor reiterated his <lb/>
former opinion, that unless the limb was at once amputated <lb/>
mortification would set in, but Sister Dora persisted that she <lb/>
could save him. The patient joyfully consented to submit to <lb/>
her treatment, but the doctor was deeply incensed. "Well, <lb/>
remember it's your arm," he said, as he walked off in high <lb/>
dudgeon. "If you choose to have that young man's death <lb/>
on your conscience I shall not interfere, but I wash my <lb/>
hands of him."</p>
<p>It was a terrible responsibility for Sister Dora, but her <lb/>
patient's confidence in her encouraged her. She watched <lb/>
"her arm," as she called it, night and day for three weeks. <lb/>
"How I prayed over that arm!" she said afterwards. At <lb/>
the end of the time she invited the doctor to see the result of <lb/>
her nursing. To his astonishment the arm, when unbandaged, <lb/>
was straightened, and in a healthy, promising condition. <lb/>
"Why, you have saved it," he exclaimed, and no wonder <lb/>
Sister Dora cried for happiness when she heard it. "Sister's <lb/>
arm," as the young man was called in the hospital, was <lb/>
devoted to her, and even when he was back at his work he <lb/>
<pb n="229"/>
would come up to have his arm looked at as an excuse for <lb/>
seeing the dear Sister again.</p>
<p>Sister Dora's influence over children was almost magical. <lb/>
Her passionate love for them taught her how to comfort <lb/>
them. She would carry about some miserable little scalded <lb/>
creature wrapped in a blanket, on one arm, instead of <lb/>
putting it to bed to cry itself to sleep. "Don't you cry&mdash;<lb/>
Sister's got you," she would say, and with her other hand she <lb/>
would dress wounds and do other things.</p>
<p>She had immense influence over the rough men and <lb/>
women who came to the hospital. She never allowed bad <lb/>
language in the wards; she made them feel the dignity of <lb/>
her presence, and she knew, too, how to make them feel <lb/>
ashamed of themselves.</p>
<p>Drunkenness was rife amongst the dwellers of the <lb/>
Black Country, and innumerable cases of hopeless bad <lb/>
legs, or old wounds breaking out afresh, were the result of <lb/>
intemperance. Sister Dora would remonstrate with her <lb/>
patients, and declared to them that unless they amended <lb/>
their ways she would not go on attending to them; but <lb/>
they knew better, and that her pity for them would never <lb/>
weary, and that she would never cease to dress their <lb/>
wounds, and try and win them to a better life. Once <lb/>
when a <hi rend="italic">proteg&eacute;</hi> of hers, a young fellow, had broken his <lb/>
promise to her, and came reeling into the ward, she laid <lb/>
down her head on the table and cried bitterly.</p>
<p>The men soon found she cared for them individually, and <lb/>
that she never forgot them. When they left the hospital <lb/>
her prayers followed them, and they knew they would <lb/>
always be sure of a welcome from "Sister."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Sister dora's</hi> sense of humour and delightful flow <lb/>
of spirits kept the wards cheerful. "Make you laugh!" <lb/>
remarked a big Irishman, "she'd make you laugh if you <lb/>
were dying." She would invent games for the boys, and <lb/>
when she had a few minutes to spare she would read to the <lb/>
men, and now and then play chess or draughts with them. <lb/>
She did not care to nurse the women, though she did her <lb/>
duty by them. She always went her rounds with the <lb/>
surgeon, and each night visited every patient. She carved <lb/>
at every meal herself, and if the out-patients were numerous <lb/>
the men would rather wait for their tea than have it served <lb/>
by any one else. She was so full of sympathy for them, <lb/>
so tender in her inquiries, so merry and full of fun, her <lb/>
father's name of Sunshine so exactly suited her, and then <lb/>
she was so natural and original.</p>
<p>"I have thoughts too big for my brains," she remarked <lb/>
once; and another time, "My dear, if I could not laugh <lb/>
<pb n="231"/>
over the things, I don't know what I should do;" for, in <lb/>
spite of her merry ways, her heart was very tender.</p>
<p>She never yielded her will in matters she considered <lb/>
important; she would employ drollery and humour and all <lb/>
manner of feminine devices to get her own way with the <lb/>
committee of management, and when every attempt failed <lb/>
would give in her resignation; this always brought them to <lb/>
reason.</p>
<p>Her position was a strangely solitary one. The clergy lived <lb/>
too far off for companionship, and her intercourse with the <lb/>
doctors was only in the way of business. She was in this <lb/>
isolated condition when a man crossed her path in whose <lb/>
society she took an ever-increasing pleasure. In intellect <lb/>
he was her superior; he could give her the sympathy and <lb/>
support for which she had longed all her life, and he loved <lb/>
her with intense devotion; but, alas! he had held sceptical <lb/>
views, and she knew this from the first.</p>
<p>It was a fearful temptation, and for a time she yielded to <lb/>
it. She became engaged to him. The same friend who had <lb/>
helped her before now pleaded with her to be true to her <lb/>
profession for the sake of others, if not for herself. In the <lb/>
end his arguments prevailed, and she was induced to <lb/>
break off her engagement; but the whole thing gave her <lb/>
acute suffering, and a severe illness ensued, an attack of <lb/>
py&aelig;mia came on, and matter formed in the knee. The old <lb/>
surgeon feared that amputation would be necessary to save <lb/>
life, but Sister Dora vowed she would rather die than <lb/>
submit to it, and ever after she showed a sad recklessness <lb/>
about her health. We read that "the poor old doctor <lb/>
went out of the hospital in tears, saying 'If Sister Dora dies <lb/>
I'll never enter these doors again.'" But she made up her <lb/>
mind that she was going to live; and after she had been a <lb/>
month ill, hearing that there was to be a serious operation <lb/>
she got out of bed and went straight to her work without <lb/>
passing through any stage of convalescence. While she was <lb/>
<pb n="232"/>
ill the young man whose arm she had saved walked eleven <lb/>
miles each Sunday to ask after her. When he received his <lb/>
answer, he said, "Tell her that's her arm that rang the <lb/>
bell," and walked back.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1869 Sister Dora did some private <lb/>
nursing; but during the three weeks she had to go back to <lb/>
Walsall twice to induce some patient to submit to a necessary <lb/>
operation.</p>
<p>Children who had been terribly burnt or scalded were <lb/>
often brought to the hospital; her treatment of the poor <lb/>
little creatures was both wise and tender. If the child <lb/>
were badly burnt, or beside itself with terror, she did not at <lb/>
once try to dress the wounds; she only excluded the air by <lb/>
means of cotton-wool, and wrapt it in a blanket, putting hot <lb/>
bottles and flannel to the feet. Then she fed it with milk <lb/>
and brandy and tried to soothe it. When the nerves were <lb/>
quieted she could then attend to the wounds without exciting <lb/>
fresh terror. If the child died, she was glad to know that <lb/>
it had not been uselessly tormented.</p>
<p>Her care for the little ones was truly maternal. She <lb/>
constantly took one, sometimes two, children into her own <lb/>
bed; and she has been known to sleep with a burnt baby on <lb/>
each arm, in spite of the sickening effluvia from the burns. <lb/>
One little girl of nine years was so badly burnt that she <lb/>
only lived a few hours. Sister Dora gave up her other <lb/>
work, and devoted herself to the dying child, talking to her <lb/>
about heaven and her Saviour. All pain had ceased, and <lb/>
the child died peacefully. Her last words were, "When <lb/>
you come to heaven, Sister, I'll meet you at the gates <lb/>
with a bunch of flowers." In the Memoirs of Sister Dora <lb/>
there is a long and interesting account, written by one of <lb/>
her lady pupils, which gives us an idea of her ordinary day's <lb/>
work at Walsall.</p>
<p>"Sister Dora," she narrates, "used to come down into <lb/>
the wards at half-past six in the morning, make the beds of <lb/>
<pb n="233"/>
all the patients who were able to get up, and give them <lb/>
their breakfast by half-past seven, when it was time for her <lb/>
own breakfast. The bright sunshiny way she always worked, <lb/>
with a smile and a pleasant word for every one, was in itself <lb/>
a medicine of the best kind.&hellip; No one had ever seen <lb/>
such a woman as this before; so beautiful, so good, so <reg orig="tender-|hearted">tenderhearted</reg>, <lb/>
so strong and so gentle, so full of fun and humour, <lb/>
and of sympathy for broken hearts as well as for every other <lb/>
kind of fracture, and the best friend that many of these poor <lb/>
maimed men had ever known.&hellip; After her own breakfast <lb/>
she read prayers on the staircase, so that all the patients in <lb/>
the three wards could hear and join. Then came the daily <lb/>
ward work, the washing up breakfast things and of patients, <lb/>
and the dressing of wounds. At half-past ten there were <lb/>
usually several out-patients who came regularly to have their <lb/>
wounds poulticed or lanced or otherwise attended to. The <lb/>
doctor generally appeared about eleven, and went his rounds. <lb/>
At twelve came the patients' dinner, at which Sister Dora <lb/>
attended minutely to every detail, and always carved herself. <lb/>
Then she read prayers in the little general sitting-room, the <lb/>
lady pupils, if there were any, and the servants only attending. <lb/>
Then followed dinner for the nurses&mdash;a very movable feast, <lb/>
sometimes put off for an hour or more, and sometimes <lb/>
omitted altogether, as far as Sister Dora was concerned, if <lb/>
any visitors whom she was obliged to see or any accidents <lb/>
came in at that time. Out-patients, who were treated every <lb/>
day, began to arrive at two, and truly their name was Legion. <lb/>
It was no uncommon event for sixty or a hundred persons <lb/>
to pass through the little rooms in the course of one <lb/>
afternoon. It was a most interesting sight to watch Sister <lb/>
Dora with her out-patients.&hellip; The doctors got through <lb/>
their part of the work quickly, for they passed on to her <lb/>
such minor operations and dressings as are entrusted to <lb/>
experienced dressers in large hospitals. The setting of <lb/>
fractures, and even the drawing of teeth, when no surgeon <lb/>
<pb n="234"/>
was present, were common operations to her. &hellip; The <lb/>
treatment of the out-patients often took between two and <lb/>
three hours, so that the in-patients' tea at five o'clock had <lb/>
sometimes to be prepared by servants, when neither Sister <lb/>
Dora nor her pupil could be spared. At half-past five or <lb/>
six the nurses had their tea. &hellip; After tea she went into <lb/>
the wards again, and this was the time to which her patients <lb/>
looked forward all day. She would go and talk to them then <lb/>
individually, or a probationer would play the harmonium <lb/>
and they would sing hymns, she joining with her strong <lb/>
cheery voice while she washed up the tea-things. &hellip; By <lb/>
eight, wounds had been dressed for the night, and the <lb/>
patients' supper was served. Sister Dora read prayers <lb/>
always, even when, as sometimes happened, her many <lb/>
duties and labours so delayed her that most of the patients <lb/>
were asleep; 'for,' she said, 'the prayers go up for them <lb/>
all the same.' Just before bedtime came her own supper, <lb/>
when she would often be very merry, and would relate her <lb/>
many remarkable experiences with intense fun and drollery."</p>
<p>Sister Dora always took the heaviest part of the work on <lb/>
herself, and she preferred doing as much as possible herself. <lb/>
She was the first up and the last to go to rest. Bishop <lb/>
Selwyn called her "the one-horse chay." She had strong, <lb/>
even violent prejudices, which she tried not to show to her <lb/>
lady pupils; but she was a patient teacher, and never grudged <lb/>
time or trouble. She said once to a lady who was engaging <lb/>
a servant for the hospital, "Tell her this is not an ordinary <lb/>
house or hospital. I want her to understand that all who <lb/>
serve here, in whatever capacity, ought to have one rule&mdash; <lb/>
love for God, and then I need not say love for their work. <lb/>
I wish we could use and really mean the word <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="Maison-|Dieu">Maison-Dieu</reg>,"</hi></p>
<p>She was a devout believer in prayer. "Pray without <lb/>
ceasing" seemed to be her motto. When the wards were <lb/>
quiet she might often be seen kneeling by the bed of some <lb/>
<pb n="235"/>
unconscious sufferer. She still continued to believe in <lb/>
presentiments. One night, after a serious amputation had <lb/>
been performed, she woke up suddenly with a strong <reg orig="con-|viction">conviction</reg> <lb/>
that something was wrong. It was impossible to <lb/>
sleep; so she got up and went to the patient, and found <lb/>
one of the larger arteries had broken away from its ligatures, <lb/>
and that he was slowly bleeding to death. She secured the <lb/>
artery in time to save his life.</p>
<p>She would never allow a corpse to remain a moment <lb/>
longer than necessary in the ward. One night a patient <lb/>
saw her take up the corpse of a man who had just died, <lb/>
and carry it straight to the mortuary. People have often <lb/>
received this story with incredulity, but it is an undoubted <lb/>
fact that Sister Dora's magnificent physique and wonderful <lb/>
strength enabled her to do more than other ordinary women. <lb/>
A friend whose sister once worked with Sister Dora told the <lb/>
writer of this sketch that Sister Dora gloried in her own <lb/>
strength. She would come into the ward with a dish <reg orig="con-|taining">containing</reg> <lb/>
a joint of beef weighing about eighteen or twenty <lb/>
pounds in one hand, and a dish of vegetables in the other, <lb/>
and say, "None of you could do this!" She was indeed an <lb/>
athlete among women. She would pick up a huge collier <lb/>
who had fallen out of bed, and put him back like a baby; <lb/>
and yet with all these strains, little food and insufficient <lb/>
rest, her health did not seem to suffer.</p>
<p>Every one knows the story of the chopped-off finger, and <lb/>
how she sent the boy back to fetch it; and how she set the <lb/>
fracture, and the finger healed.</p>
<p>In 1871 her grateful patients subscribed &pound;50, with which <lb/>
they bought a small carriage and pony, and presented them <lb/>
to her. At first Sister Dora was rather embarrassed by the <lb/>
gift, but she soon found it useful for convalescent patients <lb/>
and for visiting sick people in the town. In the March of <lb/>
1873 a mission was held at Walsall, and Sister Dora, with <lb/>
her customary energy, took an active part. In September <lb/>
<pb n="236"/>
she had a few days' holiday, and went to see the autumn <lb/>
man&oelig;uvres. In October she had a short but sharp attack <lb/>
of fever, caught in nursing a bad case; but she soon <reg orig="re-|covered">recovered</reg>, <lb/>
and wrote to a friend that "the hospital was full <lb/>
of interesting cases&mdash;one man with a compound fracture of <lb/>
each leg, and no less than thirty cuts on his head."</p>
<p>During one of her visits to Redcar she was bathing one <lb/>
day, when a woman got out of her depth. Sister Dora <lb/>
swam out to her, and tried to assist her; but the poor <lb/>
woman had lost all self-control, and clung to her so <lb/>
frantically that they were both in danger of being drowned. <lb/>
Sister Dora held her up until her cries for help attracted <lb/>
the attention of a gentleman, and he came to their rescue.</p>
<p>In August 1874 she had a well-earned holiday, and <lb/>
joined a sister and her children at Redcar. In the autumn <lb/>
of 1874 she took a number of convalescent patients to <lb/>
Rhyl. Their ages ranged from two years old to sixty. <lb/>
Only one of the patients had ever seen the sea before. It <lb/>
was an immense success. The necessary funds had been <lb/>
provided by a former lady pupil.</p>
<p>On another occasion she took seven or eight boys, all of <lb/>
whom had suffered surgical operations, to Sutton Park, near <lb/>
Walsall; and sometimes she took a number of patients, <lb/>
night-nurses, and humble friends to Lichfield for the day. <lb/>
She paid most of the expenses of the expeditions herself. <lb/>
Her charity was great. No one knew what her income <lb/>
really was; but Mr. Pattison's property was considerable, <lb/>
and it was divided among his children. Her benevolence <lb/>
was unceasing. Servants worn with illness, governesses, <lb/>
and workers were often helped. She was very anxious to <lb/>
establish a convalescent home by the seaside, but during <lb/>
her life this project was never carried out. She used to <lb/>
send her patients to the home at Coatham, until, at the end <lb/>
of 1874, she broke off all connection with the community of <lb/>
the "Good Samaritans." When questioned as to her reasons <lb/>
<pb n="237"/>
for leaving the Sisterhood, her reply was, "I am a woman, <lb/>
and not a piece of furniture."</p>
<p>When the committee received an official communication <lb/>
informing them that the Sisterhood would no longer be <lb/>
responsible for the nursing at Walsall, they at once requested <lb/>
Sister Dora to take the entire management. In November <lb/>
1874 she heard of the death of a dear sister, and for some <lb/>
time she was doubtful whether her duty did not lie with her <lb/>
bereaved brother-in-law and his motherless children; but <lb/>
after some weeks of indecision she made up her mind to <lb/>
seek advice, and she was counselled to remain at Walsall. <lb/>
During the struggle she had written: "I am afraid it is all <lb/>
selfishness on my part which makes me hesitate. No one <lb/>
knows what it will cost me to give up the work here, home, <lb/>
friends, and go to that barren moor." This decision was <lb/>
a great relief to her, and from this time she worked harder <lb/>
than ever. She literally spent herself for the sick, the <lb/>
sinful, and the sorrowful, who sent for her from all sides. <lb/>
"Send for Sister Dora" was their cry; and she never <lb/>
failed them.</p>
<p>In the early part of February 1875 there was another <lb/>
outbreak of small-pox in Walsall, which spread with frightful <lb/>
rapidity. The Mayor and Corporation had erected an <lb/>
epidemic hospital on the outskirts of the town; but the poor <lb/>
people refused to go&mdash;"they would rather die at home." <lb/>
In this dilemma Sister Dora came to the rescue. She <lb/>
offered to leave her work and nurse the small-pox patients <lb/>
and this offer was joyfully accepted by the authorities <lb/>
They knew well that if Sister Dora were in charge of the <lb/>
epidemic hospital they would be willing to send their <lb/>
relatives to be nursed there. Her generous devotion would <lb/>
save Walsall. The cottage hospital was left under the <lb/>
care of three lady pupils. She gave them no special orders; <lb/>
told them they must divide the work and do their best until <lb/>
she returned. They would have the doctor's supervision, <lb/>
<pb n="238"/>
but no one could fill her place to the unhappy small-pox <lb/>
sufferers.</p>
<p>One must touch here on a weak point in Sister Dora's <lb/>
character&mdash;a serious defect in a singularly beautiful nature: <lb/>
she was unwilling that any one should even temporarily fill <lb/>
her place. This jealousy was strangely unworthy of her; and <lb/>
there is no doubt that her work and the hospital suffered <lb/>
from her tendency to dislike any woman worker who showed <lb/>
marked ability, and who was capable of taking her place. <lb/>
This was a sad blemish, and it led to unhappy results, for it <lb/>
made her gather round her second-or third-rate workers who <lb/>
were incapable of being her rivals. It was a flaw in an <lb/>
otherwise almost perfect character; but possibly she was <lb/>
hardly aware of this defect herself. She went to the <lb/>
epidemic hospital with the conviction that she would <lb/>
probably take the complaint and die; but for once her <lb/>
presentiment was wrong.</p>
<p>The epidemic hospital stands in the midst of heaps of <lb/>
"slag," the refuse of the iron furnaces. "It seems the <lb/>
end of the earth," Miss Lonsdale tells us, "and you look <lb/>
back upon smoky Walsall, with its crowning steeple and <lb/>
teeming inhabitants, as from a desert land.&hellip; The hospital <lb/>
is a long, low building of one storey, forming two sides of a <lb/>
square, with its entrance in the angle. In front about a <lb/>
quarter of an acre of ground is planted with cabbages for <lb/>
the use of the patients, and these dismal-looking rows of <lb/>
blackened vegetables seem to add to the desolation of the <lb/>
scene. Not a tree or a bush stands up against the sky, and <lb/>
and the ancient heaps of powdered slag hide from view even <lb/>
the neighbouring collieries, and the undulating lines of the <lb/>
distant hills of Cannock Chase.</p>
<p>As Sister Dora stood on the doorstep her heart failed her, <lb/>
and she exclaimed: "Oh, take me back! I cannot endure <lb/>
this dreadful place! I had no idea what it would be like <lb/>
when I said I would come here."</p>
<pb n="239"/>
<p>Her friend, the surgeon, who escorted her, and who was <lb/>
responsible for the epidemic hospital, knew her well; he <lb/>
only said "Come in;" for he was quite sure that she would <lb/>
be delighted with the internal arrangements.</p>
<p>The two wards were large and lofty, and capable of <lb/>
division by sliding doors; the windows barred with iron&mdash;a <lb/>
necessary precaution; and excellent ventilation contrived <lb/>
from the roof. Two large day rooms, a good kitchen, a <lb/>
sitting and bedroom in one for the nurse, a tiny one for the <lb/>
porter, and a small dispensary, comprise the whole. Entirely <lb/>
separate are a good laundry, a mortuary, disinfecting oven, <lb/>
and a stable containing an ambulance.</p>
<p>Sister Dora's practical mind was charmed with these <lb/>
arrangements, and she soon told the doctor that she had <lb/>
never seen a place where work would be so delightful, and <lb/>
that the building would spoil her for the Cottage Hospital.</p>
<p>Her work began at once. The twenty-eight beds were <lb/>
soon filled. The only help she had was from the old <lb/>
porter; he was very attentive, but would occasionally go <lb/>
off "on the drink, and leave her alone the whole night <lb/>
with the dead and dying. Two old women from the <lb/>
workhouse shared with her the loathsome washing of <lb/>
clothes and bedding."</p>
<p>It must have been horrible work. Sister Dora, in one of <lb/>
her letters, speaks of the revoltingly dirty condition of some <lb/>
of the patients. "I can only venture to wash their hands <lb/>
and faces in hot water this morning," she writes. She was <lb/>
not without visitors. Her faithful friend, the doctor, brought <lb/>
her books, and flowers, and news from the Cottage Hospital. <lb/>
Old patients called. One of them, an engine-stoker, Chell, <lb/>
came continually to see her. "I could not tell you all <lb/>
her goodness to me, words would fail me if I did," was his <lb/>
remark once. His leg had been crushed in a railway <lb/>
accident, and amputation was necessary. His own words <lb/>
were: "When I come to after the chloroform she was on <lb/>
<pb n="240"/>
her knees by my side, with her arm supporting my head, <lb/>
and she was repeating&mdash;</p>
<lg type="group">
<l>'They climbed the steep ascent of heaven</l>
<l rend="indent">Through peril, toil, and pain;</l>
<l>O God, to us may grace be given</l>
<l rend="indent">To follow in their train.'</l>
</lg>
<p>And all through the pain and trouble that I had afterwards <lb/>
I never forgot Sister's voice saying those words." He was in <lb/>
the hospital for fifteen weeks, and had to endure another <lb/>
operation before he left. Sister Dora wrote three resolutions <lb/>
in a pocket-book she gave him:&mdash;(1) Come and see Sister <lb/>
Dora once a week; (2) Will go to church more regularly; <lb/>
(3) Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.</p>
<p>Sister Dora never liked Sunday visitors, because she wished <lb/>
to go to church herself, and was afraid the patients' friends <lb/>
would bring in forbidden food to their friends in her absence; <lb/>
but old patients were allowed to come. No fear of infection <lb/>
could keep Chell from his friend, and others went too.</p>
<p>Poor Sister Dora had her difficulties in the epidemic <lb/>
hospital. "I cannot get a decent woman to come and <lb/>
help," she wrote, "although we pay well. I have got two <lb/>
'critters' from the workhouse; one is so helpless, I have <lb/>
to do the work for her, and the other sits up all night, so <lb/>
can do no more. One man is so delirious, I cannot keep my <lb/>
eye off him, or else he is out of bed. Then I have a baby <lb/>
a year old, and another younger; and they are so cross, <lb/>
they keep up their music day and night." And in another <lb/>
letter later she says: "One man is blind with the pox <lb/>
Another, a woman, is very delirious; she tried to escape <lb/>
last night&mdash;it took myself and the porter to hold her down. <lb/>
That fellow is very good; he scrubbed the kitchen floor <lb/>
early this morning to save me.&hellip; I am writing while <lb/>
waiting for my potatoes to boil. My bedroom and <reg orig="sitting-|room">sitting-room</reg> <lb/>
is getting to look quite gay with flowers.&hellip; I really <lb/>
<pb n="241"/>
wish you could take a peep at me. I am very bright and <lb/>
happy, and like this hospital better than the other. I have <lb/>
all so much under my eye." By-and-by she begged her <lb/>
friend to send her all the old novels they could find, as she <lb/>
was so weary at night that only a real sensational novel <lb/>
would keep her awake.</p>
<p>She had plenty of sensational incidents in her daily work. <lb/>
One night, when the porter was off on the drink, she was <lb/>
left absolutely alone. One of the patients, a Roman Catholic, <lb/>
was dying, and begged to see a priest. She had no one to <lb/>
send, and actually went to the priest's house in the middle <lb/>
of the night, running all the way. The priest was so shocked <lb/>
at her lonely condition that he went to the Town Council <lb/>
the next morning to tell them that help must be procured <lb/>
for the Sister, but they could find no one to go.</p>
<p>Another night, when the porter was away and she was <lb/>
reading to keep herself awake,a delirious patient, a tall, <lb/>
heavy man, sprang out of bed with a loud yell and rushed <lb/>
to the door. Sister Dora did not hesitate she grappled with <lb/>
him at once, although he was covered with the horrible <lb/>
disease, confluent small-pox. She got him back to bed and <lb/>
held him until the doctor arrived. His amazement when he <lb/>
heard of the struggle was great. "Sister Dora could sit up <lb/>
at night and work all day," he observed, "with little or no <lb/>
rest, and as far as I can judge she was neither physically nor <lb/>
mentally the worse for it. Her strength was superhuman&mdash; <lb/>
I never saw such a woman." One fact seems almost <lb/>
incredible; it brings a shudder even to read it. "Sister Dora <lb/>
was in the habit of bringing to life patients who had sunk <lb/>
into the first stage of the fatal collapse which often precedes <lb/>
death, by actually putting her mouth to theirs and breathing <lb/>
into them until vitality was restored." It was not until the <lb/>
middle of August 1875 that the last small-pox patient left her, <lb/>
and she returned to Walsall Hospital after six months' <lb/>
absence. Latterly, as her work had lightened, she had <lb/>
<pb n="242"/>
visited it for a few hours at a time, after taking proper <reg orig="pre-|cautions">precautions</reg>, <lb/>
as things were in an unsatisfactory state there, and <lb/>
the surgeon had to perform serious operations without her <lb/>
assistance.</p>
<p>She always spoke lovingly of "her dear epidemic hospital;" <lb/>
but though she did not know it, a terrible piece of work was <lb/>
coming to her. In October an explosion of the furnace of <lb/>
the ironworks at Burchill, near Walsall, took place. One <lb/>
man at the top was feeding the fires and eleven others were <lb/>
resting below. The unfortunate men below were covered <lb/>
with molten metal, and in their agony jumped into the canal. <lb/>
They were rescued with difficulty, and, with the exception of <lb/>
one man who wished to be taken home, they were driven to <lb/>
the hospital.</p>
<p>The poor charred bodies hardly seemed to belong to <lb/>
human beings. Some were in terrible agony, others dying <lb/>
painlessly; some cried out to her to dress them at once. "But <lb/>
even among those stricken, tortured creatures there was one <lb/>
heroic soul. The narrative is very touching." One poor man <lb/>
named Phillips&mdash;let due honour be done to his memory&mdash; <lb/>
seeing how Sister Dora was distracted by the cries for help <lb/>
by which she was surrounded, said, "Sister Dora, I want <lb/>
to be dressed very bad, but if there's any wants you worse <lb/>
go and do them first." He was in intense agony and could <lb/>
only lie on his face; he died in the night. Some lingered <lb/>
for ten days, others longer. The sight and smell were <lb/>
horrible&mdash;even the medical men were ill and could hardly <lb/>
stay in the ward; but Sister Dora not only never went to bed <lb/>
those ten days, but stayed in the foul atmosphere and hardly <lb/>
left it day or night. It was the only time she had to fortify <lb/>
herself for her work with brandy. Some people tried to <lb/>
help, but in a few minutes they were sitting on the stairs <lb/>
faint and sick with horror. Two of the men ultimately <lb/>
recovered&mdash;one of them the man who was feeding the flames. <lb/>
He was six months in the hospital; his name was Cassidy, he <lb/>
<pb n="243"/>
was an Irishman, and he would show his burnt and shrivelled <lb/>
hands and arms as he told his story.</p>
<p>He would describe "Sister Dora going from bed to bed, <lb/>
talking, laughing, and even joking with the poor men, sitting <lb/>
by their bedsides telling stories which she hoped might <lb/>
divert them for a moment from their misery, feeding them <lb/>
with the tenderest care, helping them to bear their pain, and <lb/>
pointing out the way to heaven to those who were appointed <lb/>
to die.&hellip;" Every time he said "Sister Dora" he stood up <lb/>
and reverently pulled his forelock, as though he had <reg orig="pro-|nounced">pronounced</reg> <lb/>
the name of a saint or an angel which he was <lb/>
scarce worthy to utter. "What we felt for her I couldn't <lb/>
tell you&mdash;my tongue won't say it," he exclaimed.</p>
<p>At the end of the year 1875 the authorities of the Cottage <lb/>
Hospital were in difficulties. The ward where the poor <lb/>
sufferers from the Burchell's explosion had been was <reg orig="hope-|lessly">hopelessly</reg> <lb/>
infected, the whold place impregnated with poison. <lb/>
Erysipelas broke out, wounds would not heal, and it was <lb/>
determined the old hospital should be pulled down and a <lb/>
new and larger one built.</p>
<p>A temporary house in Bridgeman Street was found, but it <lb/>
would only hold ten beds. Sister Dora had to give up <lb/>
taking lady pupils. The situation was a noisy one; it was so <lb/>
close to the railroad that the trains shook the house, and <lb/>
she was obliged to ask the engine-driver not to let out steam <lb/>
close to the hospital as it awakened her patients, "or startled <lb/>
a burnt baby into screams for the rest of the night."</p>
<p>In November 1876, when Sister Dora and her patients <lb/>
were settled in the little home in Bridgeman Street, another <lb/>
mission was held, and she threw herself into the work. <lb/>
She suggested to the missioners that some attempt should <lb/>
be made to rescue the fallen women of the town, and they <lb/>
agreed on condition that she should herself conduct this <lb/>
part of the mission.</p>
<p>On the first night, when the services were over, she guided <lb/>
<pb n="244"/>
them into one of the worst slums of Walsall. As they turned <lb/>
into the narrow court, she said to the missioners, "Now <lb/>
keep close behind me. I am safe enough, but your lives <lb/>
are not worth a moment's purchase if you are seen here <lb/>
without me to protect you." Their reception was a rough <lb/>
one. A volley of oaths met them; but Sister Dora was not <lb/>
daunted. She spoke kindly to the women, addressing them <lb/>
by name, then she said, "Now I want you all to go down <lb/>
on your knees with me now, this moment, and say a prayer <lb/>
to God"; and to the astonishment of the clergymen the <lb/>
whole party knelt round her, and after that they followed <lb/>
her into the mission-room, where a short service followed.</p>
<p>For some time after the mission she continued to hold <lb/>
midnight services for these poor women. She also interested <lb/>
herself in the cabdrivers of Walsall, and had meetings or <lb/>
classes for them during the mission.</p>
<p>She had little rest during the mission week. As soon as she <lb/>
had dressed her patients' wounds and put them to bed, she <lb/>
went to her cabmen's gathering. When that was over she <lb/>
must have gone on to her midnight meeting, and yet by <lb/>
6.30 she was up and in the wards. During the winter of <lb/>
1876, Sister Dora, for the first time, found a difficulty in <lb/>
lifting her patients. She had contrived a method of carrying <lb/>
the dead down stairs. She would pass a broad bandage <lb/>
round the corpse, and then tying the ends round her own <lb/>
neck she would take the dead body in her strong arms and <lb/>
carry it down to the mortuary. As the difficulty increased, <lb/>
she consulted a medical man. He examined her carefully, <lb/>
and discovered the existence of a disease that must ultimately <lb/>
prove fatal. He told her that surgical aid might prolong her <lb/>
life, but after consideration she decided to let the disease <lb/>
take its course.</p>
<p>She bound the doctor to secrecy, as she resolved that <lb/>
no one should know her condition, and it was her wish to <lb/>
continue her work as long as possible, and if people knew <lb/>
<pb n="245"/>
she was ill or suffering they might harass her with kindly <lb/>
meant remonstrances. She promised to consult him <reg orig="when-|ever">whenever</reg> <lb/>
it was necessary, but wished to have no regular medical <lb/>
attendance. It must have been a terrible moment for the <lb/>
heroic worker to hear her death-warrant pronounced. She <lb/>
was apparently in the fulness of health and strength, <reg orig="brim-|ming">brimming</reg> <lb/>
over with life and spirits; no wonder she needed all <lb/>
her self-control and fortitude. She was doomed, and she <lb/>
knew it; and her resolve was taken at once,&mdash;to devote <lb/>
the whole energy of her body and soul to make the utmost <lb/>
of the time left to her.</p>
<p>She worked harder than ever. "I grudge every moment <lb/>
I must spend in taking care of the body," she wrote to a <lb/>
friend who knew nothing of her condition. "I fairly grudge <lb/>
myself the time which must be spent in sleep."</p>
<p>Her little pony-carriage was used nearly every day. <lb/>
From six till ten or eleven at night she drove to see <lb/>
patients who could not be received into the hospital, and <lb/>
her chief happiness was to pass the night beside some <lb/>
dying patient, soothing and comforting the sufferer. The <lb/>
midnight classes for women were still carried on during the <lb/>
winter of 1876.</p>
<p>Her expeditions at night in the cold and wet brought on <lb/>
a return of acute inflammation, and for a short time she was <lb/>
dangerously ill; but kind "Sister Death" refused to take <lb/>
her in her merciful arms, and in spite of her prayers Sister <lb/>
Dora recovered. Who could wonder that she longed to die, <lb/>
and that even her indomitable spirit quailed at the thought <lb/>
of those months of suffering that were before her? But with <lb/>
recovery her courage and cheerfulness returned. The new <lb/>
hospital was being built, and Sister Dora took a great interest <lb/>
in the plans.</p>
<p>She still continued her nocturnal visits, and had some <lb/>
unpleasant experiences. Once, as she was driving to Sutton <lb/>
two ruffians sprang out of the hedge and seized the pony's <lb/>
<pb n="246"/>
head, only a man on horseback came round the corner and <lb/>
they ran away.</p>
<p>Another dark night a man with a thick stick rushed after <lb/>
them. The porter, who always drove Sister Dora, whipped <lb/>
up the pony. "I had only time," she said, "for a short <lb/>
prayer, when the stick was brought down heavily on the <lb/>
back of the carriage. I had leant instinctively to one side <lb/>
as I had said my prayer, and so my head escaped the blow <lb/>
that was intended for it." The porter always declared that <lb/>
the ruffians did not know whom they were attacking. He <lb/>
looked upon those drives as some of the jolliest hours of <lb/>
his life. "She never stopped talking," he would say, "and <lb/>
telling me stories."</p>
<p>Her friend, Mr. Twigg, had been dangerously, ill and had <lb/>
gone to Sutton for change of air, and she often visited him <lb/>
there.</p>
<p>Towards the early spring the symptoms of her disease <lb/>
increased so rapidly that, at the urgent request of her doctor <lb/>
she consulted Mr. Crompton of Birmingham, from whose <lb/>
opinion there could be no appeal. He endorsed the opinion <lb/>
of her medical adviser. Though there were no signs of illness <lb/>
about her, the cancer was increasing and surgical dressing <lb/>
became necessary. She attended to the wound herself, and <lb/>
although she had three cases of the same kind under her <lb/>
care whose wounds she regularly dressed, she adhered to <lb/>
her resolution not to seek help.</p>
<p>One night the doctor summoned her to look at a child <lb/>
who was in the last stages of diphtheria. As a last hope he <lb/>
performed the operation of tracheotomy. Sister Dora knelt <lb/>
down by the bed, and putting her mouth to the incision <lb/>
cleared the child's throat of the poisonous mucus. The <lb/>
child recovered, to die of another disease, and Sister Dora <lb/>
had diphtheritic sore throat for three weeks. In June 1878 <lb/>
she left for a fortnight's holiday; on her return typhoid fever <lb/>
broke out in the temporary hospital in Bridgeman Street, <lb/>
<pb n="247"/>
and it was necessary to close it. She very soon found <lb/>
herself at liberty, and in August she left Walsall, feeling <lb/>
sure that she would never work there again. She joined <lb/>
some of her nieces who were spending the summer in <lb/>
the Isle of Man. She was in high spirits, and the only <lb/>
difference her relatives noticed was she did not walk so far <lb/>
or so fast as she used to do. She taught her nieces to <lb/>
swim, and seemed full of life and health. In the autumn <lb/>
she went to Paris to see the Exhibition, and to study the <lb/>
wonderful inventions in the way of surgical appliances. At <lb/>
the end of September she was in London, where she <lb/>
intended to study Professor Lister's treatment of wounds, <lb/>
with a view of using his method in the hospital. She <lb/>
stayed at a nursing home in Fitzroy Square, where she was <lb/>
permitted to witness his operations. Her own disease was <lb/>
making rapid strides, and her cough increased so terribly <lb/>
that one of the London doctors proposed to examine her <lb/>
chest. In terror that her secret would be discovered by <lb/>
a stranger, she hurried off to Birmingham to consult Mr. <lb/>
Crompton.</p>
<p>Fatigue and anxiety of mind brought on fatal symptoms, <lb/>
and it was thought she would never leave Birmingham <lb/>
alive. Mr. Crompton wished to take her into his own <lb/>
house, but she begged to be moved to Walsall. "Let me <lb/>
die among my own people," was her cry.</p>
<p>The surgeon of the Walsall Hospital removed her in his <lb/>
own carriage, and she was taken to a small house that <lb/>
the committee had hired for her.</p>
<p>She wrote to a dear friend, a clergyman: "I wonder <lb/>
what you will say when you hear the decree has gone out&mdash; <lb/>
'Sister, put thy house in order, for thou shalt die and not <lb/>
live.' Such is the verdict of the doctors; such my own <lb/>
feelings this time&hellip; I have not had two hours' sleep for <lb/>
four days and nights, but in the midst of the fiery furnace <lb/>
there was a form like unto the Son of God. &hellip;"</p>
<pb n="248"/>
<p>Sister Dora still enjoined secrecy on her doctors, and <lb/>
it was commonly believed that she was dying of <reg orig="con-|sumption">consumption</reg>. <lb/>
"Her'll get well," the people said, "her <lb/>
never can be going to die"; but this conviction was <lb/>
followed by despair, when, in answer to their anxious <lb/>
inquiries, they received the answer, "No hope&mdash;only a <lb/>
question of time."</p>
<p>Sister Dora had hoped that she might recover sufficiently <lb/>
to be able to be carried to the door of the new hospital, <lb/>
which was nearly completed, to declare it open with her <lb/>
own lips; but this last hope vanished. After her return to <lb/>
Walsall she never left her bed. Her sufferings increased. <lb/>
She soon was unable to take solid food, and incessant <lb/>
sickness set in. She could only obtain sleep by the use of <lb/>
opiates, until at last they ceased to have effect. Her <lb/>
old servant, Mrs. H., with the help of two other <reg orig="night-|nurses">night-nurses</reg>, <lb/>
nursed her through the night, and she was obliged <lb/>
at last to let Mrs. H. dress her wound when the doctor was <lb/>
not available to help her do it herself. She would not send <lb/>
for any of her own family. When two of her sisters went <lb/>
to Walsall for a week, in her morbid desire for concealment <lb/>
she would not allow them to nurse her, and they were <lb/>
obliged to leave her. Even on her deathbed her proud <lb/>
reticence and strong will prevailed. She told her doctors <lb/>
she would not give people the opportunity of "saying that <lb/>
she killed herself by her mode of life," and as long as <lb/>
possible she hid her physical suffering.</p>
<p>The approach of death&mdash;merciful death&mdash;was only a joy <lb/>
to her. She had struggled so hard for twenty months, and <lb/>
she was so worn out and weary. But this joy and relief was <lb/>
followed by deep depression, and "a horrible dread" of <lb/>
dying oppressed her. "I cannot pray, I cannot think; I <lb/>
sadly fear I shall be lost," were her words: "I can only <lb/>
trust." But even in this darkness her faith enabled her to <lb/>
cling to the cross, though her bright, hopeful spirit seemed <lb/>
<pb n="249"/>
quenched in those deep waters. "I am in God's hands <lb/>
now," was her cry.</p>
<p>Her one earthly anxiety was to find some one competent <lb/>
to take charge of the new hospital. To her relief a <lb/>
friend and former lady pupil promised to undertake the <lb/>
nursing until a permanent head could be found, and on <lb/>
November 4th the hospital was opened in Sister Dora's <lb/>
name. She took great delight in the silver key in a velvet <lb/>
case which was sent to her by the committee.</p>
<p>Whenever she rallied, she showed her old interest in her <lb/>
friends' welfare. Her old patients who came to see her were <lb/>
received with beaming smiles, though perhaps a few minute <lb/>
before she had been groaning with pain. Some of them said <lb/>
"she was that cheerful and jolly that they were sure she <lb/>
would come round."</p>
<p>When her sufferings increased, and she could not pray for <lb/>
herself, she would beg her nurse to pray aloud. "I am not <lb/>
half so good and patient as many of those I have nursed," <lb/>
she would say.</p>
<p>Towards the end of November she grew suddenly worse, <lb/>
and then rallied again, to the amazement of her doctors. <lb/>
The measure of her pain and discipline was not yet full. <lb/>
One who was constantly with her wrote: "I shall never <lb/>
forget the unselfishness, brightness, and patience with which <lb/>
she bore her long trial. Her sufferings were sad to see; but <lb/>
even when she was moaning with pain, which she said was <lb/>
like the cutting of a knife, she would go on dictating (her <lb/>
letters) as best she could between her moans.&hellip; Her <lb/>
sorrow was that she could not realise God's presence more, <lb/>
and her fear was, lest she should seem impatient.&hellip; I <lb/>
feel that I cannot give you any true idea of those last hours <lb/>
that I spent with her, as her brave and loving spirit waited <lb/>
for the moment when God would call her to the full, <lb/>
unclouded daylight of eternity, into the dawn of which she <lb/>
seemed already to have entered."</p>
<pb n="250"/>
<p>During the last three weeks of her life the course of <lb/>
circulation in her right arm became impeded, and it swelled <lb/>
so painfully that it had to be supported with a cushion. <lb/>
In addition to her other complaint, she suffered from <lb/>
consolidation of the right lung, which caused impeded <lb/>
respiration and distressing cough. But as she sat propped <lb/>
up by pillows she seemed to regain her youthful beauty, <lb/>
and only the touch of white in her hair testified to her age. <lb/>
On Saturday, December 21st, the end seemed approaching, <lb/>
and Sister Dora's depression increased; it was the last time, <lb/>
and her faith triumphed. "I never saw such faith and <lb/>
patience," was the testimony of one of her nurses. On the <lb/>
morning of the 24th she said, "I am dying; run for Sister <lb/>
Ellen." In the biography we read that her faithful attendant <lb/>
"Mrs. H. tried to soothe her, saying, 'Our Blessed Lord is <lb/>
standing at the gates of heaven to open them for you.' But <lb/>
she no longer needed such consolation, for all her darkness <lb/>
was gone, and she answered, 'I see Him there; the gates <lb/>
are opened wide.'&hellip; When all human efforts for her relief <lb/>
were exhausted," it continues, "she said, as they stood <lb/>
watching her, 'I have lived alone; let me die alone,' <reg orig="re-|peating">repeating</reg> <lb/>
'let me die alone,' till they were forced to leave her, <lb/>
one friend only watching through the half-open door."</p>
<p>They laid her to rest in Walsall Cemetery on December 28th. <lb/>
No one who was present will ever forget that sight. In spite <lb/>
of half-melting snow and drizzling rain, hundreds of old <lb/>
patients followed, until almost the whole of the population <lb/>
seemed to join the procession. There were four workhouse <lb/>
funerals at the same time, and the service was read over all <lb/>
five at once. There was no room in the chapel, and Sister <lb/>
Dora's coffin was placed in the porch; as one of the nurses <lb/>
remarked, "that was just as Sister Dora would have wished&mdash; <lb/>
not to be divided, even in death, from the poor people she <lb/>
loved so well." The inscription on the coffin was: "Sister <lb/>
Dora. Entered into rest 24th December, 1878." Her <lb/>
<pb n="251"/>
great wish to sing her Christmas carol in heaven had been <lb/>
granted her.</p>
<p>Seldom has a more beautiful life been lived upon this <lb/>
earth. It was spent in the service of Christ's poor, in <lb/>
ministering to the sick, the sorrowful, and the sinful. Can <lb/>
we doubt that to her the blessed words have been said: <lb/>
"Inasmuch as ye did it unto the least of these My brethren, <lb/>
ye did it unto Me."</p>
