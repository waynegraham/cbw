                            <p>Margaret Lonsdale's seminal biography about the life and work of
                                Sister Dora. The first ("Copyright") edition, vol. 1911 in
                                Collection of British Authors, Leipzig: Tauchnitz, 1880 (with "The
                                right of translation is reserved," this was a standard imprint to
                                establish copyright), has the epigraph from Spenser and the
                                frontispiece portrait of Sister Dora that is adapted in many
                                illustrations; it is essentially the photograph credited to Mrs.
                                Williams, Wolverhampton, in our "carousel" above. Unlike later
                                editions, the first edition presents this frontispiece above a
                                printed script "signature" of the subject and at the bottom of the
                                page an illegible (apparently holograph) identification of the
                                image. Lonsdale in the preface (in later editions, "Preface to the
                                First Edition") faults this portrait: "Mr. Jeens was seriously ill
                                when he undertook it," so it lacks the "spirit" of the living
                                original and the photograph (Little, Brown, 1880: iii-iv). This
                                preface also explains that Lonsdale has preferred to avoid the "many
                                stories...possessing an element of the marvellous, nay, of the
                                supernatural, which would have made her biography sensational, as
                                well as more interesting....I never heard one of these stories from
                                her own lips"; they arose from "the veneration...by the ignorant and
                                the superstitious, as well as by the credulous among the educated"
                                (iv-v).</p>
                            <p>"Preface to the Fourth Edition," dated January 31, 1880, notes
                                deletions of letters (included in second and third editions)
                                concerning Sister Dora's deathbed conversion: she in fact "never
                                became a member of the Roman Catholic Church" (268). Lonsdale has
                                also removed mention of autopsy (vii-viii). She alludes to an outcry
                                against her in Walsall, and insists that Sister Dora wanted her own
                                life to be written; in final "justification," Lonsdale adds that
                                this life is "public property," not the exclusive treasure of
                                Walsall (viii-ix). With these alterations, the American editions are
                                "From the Sixth English Edition," and those in 1880-1881 through
                                1914 (32nd ed.) appear to use identical plates, though pagination
                                varies depending on whether it begins with front matter or chapter
                                one. London: Kegan Paul, 1881 omits the preface to the fourth
                                edition.</p>

                        <date>(1788-1865)</date> and <name type="mother"/>Jane Winn
                            <date>(1793-1860)</date>, daughter of a banker and former mayor of
                        Richmond. Rev. Pattison was strictly evangelical and mentally unstable; his
                        wife was induced to commit him to an asylum for almost a year in 1834-1835.
                        The eldest son, <name type="brother">Mark Pattison</name>
                        <date>(1813-1884)</date>, became an Oxford don and for a time joined the
                        high-church Oxford Movement. The father tried to cut off all communication
                        between the nine sisters at home and this supposed Papist infection, though
                        Mark fostered Dorothy's education and she was often his companion on
                        holidays and visits. Many biographies depict a happy childhood for the
                        somewhat frail but beautiful child, said to be called her father's "Little
                        Sunshine." Dorothy is said to have "inherited from her father, who was of a
                        Devonshire family, that finely proportioned and graceful figure... and from
                        her mother...those lovely features which drew forth the admiration of
                        everyone who had the pleasure of knowing her" (M + S, 241). The sisters were
                        occupied in caring for their ailing mother, works of charity among the
                        villagers, and outdoor exercise, including Dorothy's great pleasure, riding
                        to hounds. Yet the father gave formal education to his two sons only,
                        resisted all suitors and disowned the daughters who married, and tried in
                        every way to contain his daughters and wife within the home and according to
                        his will. Biographies of Dorothy emphasize her innate strong will, source of
                        the greatness as well as the difficulties of her life.</p>

                    <p>Although Dorothy wished to join Florence Nightingale as a nurse during the
                        Crimean War (1853-1856), her father forbade her to leave home, pointing out
                        that without training, she would be "worse than useless" on the front. Most
                        biographies omit what the ODNB matter-of-factly understates: "Tall and
                        pretty, Dorothy Pattison was in love with several men during her life, both
                        before and after she took religious vows." An engagement to a handsome
                        farmer and soon another to a respectable clergymen both came to nothing,
                        under the disapproval of her family and her own reluctance to give up her
                        vocation for anything less than passion. After Dorothy's mother died in
                        1861, Dorothy won the great point of independence, serving as village
                        schoolmistress at Little Woolston, Buckinghamshire, for three years. There,
                        "She had to live alone in a cottage, and do everything for her self; but the
                        people never for a moment doubted she was a real lady, and always treated
                        her with great respect" (M + S 242).</p>

                    <p>One of her frequent illnesses led her to take a holiday to recuperate at
                        Coatham, near Middlesborough, where she visited an Anglican sisterhood and
                        observed their work in a convalescent home. In September 1864 she joined the
                        Christ Church sisterhood, adopting the name Sister Dora. Most accounts
                        stress her humiliation under the housework and impersonal discipline, though
                        she has already prided herself on being able to cook. Many accounts tell of
                        her bursting into tears "when the beds which she had just put in order were
                        all pulled to pieces by some superior authority, who did not approve of the
                        method in which they were made" (M + S 242). The sisterhood trained and then
                        dispatched nurses to small hospitals and private patients, and for some
                        years Sister Dora's assignments frequently changed. In January 1865 she was
                        sent to Walsall, a manufacturing district near Birmingham, where a small
                        cottage hospital had been formed in 1863 for emergency treatment of
                        industrial injuries from the coal mines, iron pits, tanneries, and railways.
                        Her decision to join the sisterhood meant a breach with her family, who
                        considered the work demeaning; Mark disapproved of her "romance" with
                        self-sacrifice. Many biographies repeat the idea that the sisterhood
                        prevented her from attending her father's deathbed and funeral (1865), and
                        that this led to her decision to leave the sisterhood. More recent accounts
                        make it clear that the breach with the sisterhood came later, when she made
                        her own decisions about her nursing assignments, and that bad relations with
                        her family as well as mistimed messages led to her not going home at that
                        time.</p>

                    <p>The first appearance of volunteer nurses, resembling Catholic nuns, caused
                        some distrust, and there are anecdotes about local people believing that
                        secret rituals were performed in a closed-off room in the hospital, or about
                        one boy who threw a stone that hit Sister Dora on the forehead, calling her
                        a "Sister of Misery." But soon professional men and workers all were won
                        over by Sister Dora's beauty, humor, graceful manners, and dedicated hard
                        work. By 1867, when a new hospital had to be built, Sister Dora was put in
                        charge, and clearly demonstrated her administrative skills as well as her
                        increasing expertise in treating wounds and illnesses. Religion infused
                        everything she did, from prayers and songs to the stories she told and
                        letters she wrote explaining her vocation, but evidently it was a
                        non-sectarian, populist form of belief that attracted her patients and
                        helped them to recover. She often said when a patient's bell would wake her
                        in the night, "The Master is come, and calleth for thee!" She once wrote to
                        a friend, who was engaging a servant for the hospital, "this is not an
                        ordinary house, or even a hospital...all who serve here...ought to have one
                        rule, <hi rend="italics">love for God</hi>, and then, I need not say, love
                        for their work."</p>
                    <p>All biographies of Sister Dora assemble the picture of an admirable
                        personality, some pushing the limits of credibility toward the heights of
                        sainthood. At the same time, almost all note the flaw that she herself
                        acknowledged, self-will. But without her driving sense of purpose and
                        resistance to obstacles, "it is doubtful whether she could have achieved all
                        she did," as Mabie and Stephen put it (following Lonsdale and Baring-Gould).
                        Women who came to Walsall to study nursing with her (she often had
                        "lady-pupils") objected that she would not let anyone help her and did not
                        delegate well, even that she had little appreciation of women. From a later
                        perspective, Sister Dora seems to have gained power through a version of
                        self-denial not dissimilar to an eating disorder or suicidal tendencies; the
                        famous risks she took with infections make more sense as ways to court death
                        when her own desires were defeated.</p>

                    <p>As noted, the biographies downplay Sister Dora's series of attachment to
                        suitors; most seem unaware of any such possibilities of marriage, though
                        some note that she was severely tested by her love for a medical man,
                        possibly Redfern Davies, whom she met in Walsall, her equal in many
                        qualities but an unbeliever. After a struggle, she decided to continue her
                        vocation and sustain her dedication to Jesus. Only since the 1930s have
                        letters reappeared that reveal that Sister Dora had a relationship in 1876
                        with a younger man, an industrialist, Kenyon Jones. Jo Manton considers
                        Sister Dora "the prisoner of her own legend" (306); she had to keep their
                        love a secret. The legend drew upon the beauty, purity, and gentility of a
                        lady, but her vocation permitted considerable bodily intimacy and
                        participation in graphic scenes and physical tasks unusual for the type.</p>
                    <p>There are several episodes of her intimacy with dying or wounded men that
                        combine sympathy, horror, and iconic heroism. One night she came to the home
                        of a man who was dying of small-pox; all his relatives and neighbors had
                        fled, including a woman she had sent to buy a candle, who never returned. As
                        she sat with the man, he asked her, "Sister, kiss me before I die." And as
                        the candle expired, she embraced the man, with his running sores, and sat
                        with him in the darkness all night, finding in the morning that he had died
                        in her arms. Another favorite narrative tells of a boy whose right arm had
                        been crushed by machinery. The surgeon insisted that it must be amputated to
                        save the boy's life, but Sister Dora wished to try to save the limb that
                        meant the boy's livelihood. The surgeon warned her (some accounts consider
                        him offended by her challenge to his authority)that the life of the patient
                        was her responsibility. With three weeks' constant care and prayer to heal
                        the wound, the arm became whole and healthy, and we are told the surgeon was
                        impressed, as the boy was forever grateful. He is said to have gained the
                        nickname "Sister's Arm." There are less common but equally uplifting
                        episodes of her counselling a young dying girl or befriending a convalescent
                        child who never forgot her care; children figure more generally as testimony
                        to Sister Dora's nurturing love. Walsall was full of former patients and
                        family members who remembered her generous, personal care and who would come
                        to see how she was during any illness. Every Sunday "Sister's Arm" would
                        walk many miles to the hospital to ask for Sister Dora, and say "Tell her
                        it's <hi rend="italics">her arm</hi> that rang the bell" (Fawcett
                        190-91)</p>

                    <p>Sister Dora worked with little pause throughout the day and night, visiting
                        all beds, supervising all meals, often skipping her own food or rest. She
                        was seldom seen sitting down. This work was enlivened with a sense of
                        performance and playfulness, singing and telling tales that entertained her
                        patients, whom she gave nicknames and special notice or favors. Yet the work
                        was repeatedly interrupted by serious illness; she seemed careless about
                        infection, coming in contact with all kinds of disease and exposed to all
                        weathers. </p>

                    <p>Other than her illnesses, her years of service in Walsall are shaped by
                        memorable catastrophes for the workers in the town, events featured in the
                        vividly realist bas-reliefs surrounding the base of the statue that Walsall
                        erected after her death. One was colliery disaster in 1872, and another was
                        an explosion in 1875 of a furnace at Birchett's Iron Works which covered
                        eleven men in molten metal. For ten days without resting Sister Dora bravely
                        tended to the victims in a special ward that pupil-nurses and doctors were
                        loath to enter, faced with the stench, the cries, and the sight of charred
                        bodies. Only two men survived. Yet another heroic episode came with a
                        renewed epidemic of small-pox; to convince the people to go to a quarantine
                        hospital, Sister Dora volunteered to place herself in isolation there. She
                        showed no concern for her own risk, but it meant many months of hard labor
                        because there were only a few unreliable servants.</p>

                    <p>Contemporary newspapers before and after her death began to record the
                        remarkable deeds of this self-sacrificing servant of the suffering poor. Her
                        medical colleagues attested to her skill in various branches of care, from
                        surgery to the dressing of wounds to the treatment of eye injuries; late in
                        life she studied the work of Lister on antiseptic treatment in London, but
                        she had chosen not to pursue further medical training in favor of her
                        particular hands-on mission among the workers. This mission included
                        rounding up prostitutes and clearing out the pubs for midnight prayer
                        meetings in the town. Many locals recalled her with reverence as a kind of
                        saint, and some believed she could work miracles. Gifts and testimonials
                        included a pony and cart given to her by railway men; she used it to make
                        house calls, and to take convalescents on jaunts. She particularly liked to
                        use her own funds to sponsor feasts for patients and holidays for the poor
                        children who were recovering from illness or injury. She hid the records of
                        the extent of her charities.</p>
                    <p>For many months she also kept secret her mortal illness, an inoperable breast
                        cancer, continuing to work as long as she could and planning the
                        construction and move into a new hospital that was begun in 1877. Here, a
                        passage in Baring-Gould and Mabie and Stephen offers a portrait of the
                        heroine's motives: <quote>She could not endure pity. She, to whom everybody
                            had learnt instinctively to turn for help and consolation, on whom
                            others leant for support, must she now come down to ask of them sympathy
                            and comfort? The pride of life was still surging up in her, that pride
                            which had made her glory in her physical strength for its own sake, as
                            well as for its manifold uses in the service of her Master. True, she
                            had been long living two lives inseparably blended: the outward life of
                            hard, unceasing toil; the inner, a constant communion with the unseen
                            world, the existence of which she realised to an extent which not even
                            those who saw the most of her could appreciate. To all the poor,
                            ignorant beings whose souls she tried to reach by means of their maimed
                            bodies, she was, indeed, the personification of all that they could
                            conceive as lovable, holy and merciful in the Saviour. (M+S 259)</quote>
                        After a brief holiday, she returned to Walsall in her final illness, and
                        died on 24 December, 1878. Her last wish, they say, was to die alone. And
                        some said, and had to be convinced otherwise, that she converted to
                        Catholicism on her deathbed.</p>






                    <p>Her funeral on the 28th of December was a town spectacle, a procession of
                        thousands. In 1886, a statue by Francis Williamson was erected in another
                        public ceremony, following upon a stained-glass window in St. Matthew's
                        Church (1882-1883). </p>
                    <p>The Walsall writer of "A Review," quoted by Baring-Gould and Mabie and
                        Stephens, concludes:</p>

                    <quote>She is no idol to us, but we worship her memory as the most saintly thing
                        that was ever given us. Her name is immortalised, both by her own surpassing
                        goodness, and by the love of a whole people for her—a love that will survive
                        through generations, and give a magic and a music to those simple words,
                        "Sister Dora," long after we shall have passed away. There was little we
                        could ever do—there was nothing she would let us do—to relieve the
                        self-imposed rigours of her life; but we love her in all sincerity, and now
                        in our helplessness we find a serene joy in the knowledge that to her, as
                        surely as to any human soul, will be spoken the divine words: "Inasmuch as
                        ye have done it unto the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto
                        Me."(M + S 264)</quote>

                    <p>Sister Dora's reputation as a modern saint was international for some
                        decades. She appeared in as many as twenty collective biographies besides
                        numerous biographical reference works and countless essays and articles. And
                        even Susan McGann's 2004 biography in ODNB ends with this same quotation
                        from Matthew 25:40.</p>

                            but alas!" her father caught a fatal chill. Carey juxtaposes the father's death with the vitality of the future queen, dwelling on 
                            a sentimental anecdote from an unidentified biography: 
                            <rs type="narrative_elements" key="anecdote">"There is a sweet word-picture here; for we are told that the royal infant, 
                                'being held up at the carriage window to bid the assembled population of Sidmouth farewell, 
                                sported and laughed joyously, and patted the glass with her pretty dimpled hands, in happy unconsciousness of her
                                melancholy bereavement.'...how vividly one seems to see it!"</rs>
                            <milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_rhetoric" ana="emphasis"/>  The anecdote uncannily anticipates many public spectacles of Victoria's
                        joy and grief, and even anticipates something of the disproportion between occasion and feeling that many witnessed in her later life.</p>
                       <p>Carey makes her own public display of disproportionate affect in the effort to shape a narrative about the living Queen.  She frequently relies
                           on direct address, emphasis, cliched tropes and topoi, and other narrative rhetoric and conventions of biography as a genre.  Thus, in the fifth and sixth
                           paragraphs, each a sentence long:</p>

                               Every writer who has striven to pourtray the leading incidents of Queen Victoria's life has seized eagerly

	<p>Vivid the episodes may be, but how to reassemble them from the pieces eagerly seized?  How to avoid the effect of a curtain rising again and again?  
	    What more can the audience do than feel again the charming sentiments nationally rehearsed throughout their lifetimes? The biographer's progress is 
	    necessarily slow through this catalogue of gems.  "The great philanthropist <name>William Wilberforce</name> writes to <name corresp="HANNAH_MORE">Hannah More</name>, on <date>July 21st, 1820</date>" of an invitation
	    to wait on the Duchess of Kent.  "'She received me with her fine animated child on the floor beside her with her playthings, of which I soon became one.'  The life at Kensington
	    Palace was as simple as that of any English household" (18). The future queen
	    is capable of making fond fools of statesmen, it seems&mdash;or of making a domestic scene a matter of state.  The "severe simplicity of that Royal 
	    household," described by those who witnessed it from the outside or within, becomes a model of the nation, cosy (Princess and mother always share a 
	    bedroom) and bucolic (on summer days, they take their simple breakfast outdoors among flowers and birds); run like clockwork, a program of self-improvement.  Several sources attribute national well-being
	    to the disciplined program that kept Victoria morally in tune, albeit lonely and a bit taxed with surveillance.

         <p><name>Baroness Lehzen</name>, the governess, plays her part in narratives of 
        Victoria's <rs corresp="life_events" key="education">education.</rs>  In a <milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_elements" ana="quotation_letter"/>             
        letter to the Queen dated <date>December 2nd, 1867</date>, the Baroness recalls "'some remarkable words of your Majesty 
        when only twelve years old, while the Regency Bill was still in progress.<milestone unit="subject" corresp="history" ana="campaign"/> I 
        then said to the <rs corresp="agents" key="mother">Duchess of Kent</rs> that now for the first time your Majesty ought to know your place
        in the succession.'"<milestone unit="subject" corresp="life_events" ana="vocation"/> The two older women agreed to place the genealogy in the girl's
        history book, as part of the lesson her tutor expected her to learn.  The Princess remarks on the information she has just encountered, 
             <milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_elements" ana="dialogue"/>"'I never 
        saw that before.... I see I am nearer the throne than I thought.' 'So it is, Madam,' I said. After some moments, the Princess resumed, 'Now, 
        many a child would boast; ...There is much splendour, but much responsibility.' The Princess, having lifted up the forefinger of her right hand, 
        gave me that little hand, saying, 'I will be good, dear Lehzen; I will be good.'"<milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_rhetoric" ana="example"/>  This
        is where most biographies cease to quote the twelve-year-old, but Lehzen continues with the valid point that the succession could go otherwise, Adelaide (wife of Willim IV)being still 
        capable of childbearing.  The Princess said, we're told, that she wouldn't be disappointed, since Adelaide is fond of children.  Carey, supporting
        the thesis of Baroness Lehzen's letter, "One must surely allow that these were remarkable words to be spoken by a child of twelve" (21).</p>
                    
	<p>Carey's next theme is the excellent plan of the Duchess of Kent to raise a truly English daughter,<milestone unit="subect" corresp="narrative_rhetoric"
	ana="trope_national_spirit"/> familiar with her homeland and adjusted to the adulation of her people.<milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_rhetoric" ana="topos_recognition"/> 
	Curiously, the strains between factions in the royal family appear, even in Carey's rigorously rosy picture.  Carey focuses on milestones in the 
	girl's life, diligently recording the Princess's presentation at <rs corresp="places" key="court">"Court</rs> on Queen Adelaide's birthday, 
	    on <date>February 24th, 1831;</date> her conspicuous absence at the coronation of William IV. and Queen Adelaide (due to Victoria's frail
	    health); and the "touching" scene of her confirmation on <date>August 30th, 1835</date> in the Chapel Royal. 
	Parliament had named the Duchess of Kent as Regent,<milestone unit="subject" corresp="history" ana="government"/> granting annual support
	    totalling £16,000. All most fitting, in Carey's view, but King William IV seems to have stepped out of his gracious majesty's part at 
	    his own birthday dinner, a "painful" scene in which he publicly prayed to survive till the Princess would be of age to rule, to avoid a regency
	    "in the hands of a person near me, who is surrounded by evil advisers, and who is herself 
	    incompetent to act with propriety in the station in which she would be placed." The Princess was commanded in future to "appear 
 at Court on all occasions." </p>
	<p>The romance plot for this princess has more than usual inevitability, as in Carey's retelling both families had been planting the idea of 
	    marriage between the cousins since their childhoods.  "The Prince used to relate that when he was a child of three years old 
	    his nurse always 
	told him that he should marry the Queen."  King Leopold and his advisors encouraged this probability as much as Victoria's associates did, but all
	parties wished the match to be an affinity, if possible, one of companionable love. Thus the plot was to be kept secret till the cousins should 
	have met and taken a liking to each other. The Duchess of Kent invited the Duke of Coburg and his sons Ernest and Albert for a visit of 
	 "nearly four weeks at Kensington Palace, and the cousins spent delightful days together, playing duets on the piano, 
	sketching, walking and riding, and visiting the chief attractions of the Metropolis."</p>
	
	<p>Thus in 1836, when Victoria was seventeen, the future union of Victoria and Albert seems confirmed. The Princess herself in a letter to her uncle King Leopold
	    asked him to take care of Albert so that her hopes might be fulfilled.  Carey concludes her first chapter when Victoria comes of age in May, 1837,
	the public celebrations followed quickly by the death of William IV.</p>
	
                    <p>The second chapter, "Accession and Marriage," begins with two well-known epigraphs by <rs corresp="cbw_subject_not_featured" key="pop_chart"><name>Elizabeth Barrett Browning</name></rs>,
                        her praise of "the weeping Queen" who "wept to wear a crown," and a tercet from "A Vision of Poets" on the close association of "church
                        and mart," "dream or grave."  Carey meditates on the proximity of death in the happiest of times in life&mdash;"Life and death, buoyant youth and senile decay, and 
light tripping feet moving with averted eyes among the graves!"&mdash; pointing to the repentant death of William IV as preamble 
to the rise of the young queen (27). The emblem of corrupt (masculine) age and innocent (feminine) youth was irresistible, as Charles 
Dickens's <title><hi
    > rend= "italics">The Old Curiosity Shop</hi></title> suggested in the early days of Victoria's reign (<date>1840-1841</date>).</p>
<p>Carey retails the emblematic scene, the annunciation to the virgin princess that she would become symbolic sovereign, ruler of elder men. We are hailed
    as Victorian readers asking to hear a favorite story of childhood once more:
    "A Royal Idyll indeed!—it reads to us still like a fairy tale; we heard it first at our mother's 
    knee" (28). The Angel Gabriel, in this tale, takes the form of court dignitaries, arriving at the palace to wake the Princess to her new
    <milestone unit="subject" corresp="life_events" ana="vocation"/>calling.  Carey quotes "Miss Wynn in her 'Diary of a Lady of Quality'": the Princess
    "'came into the room in a loose white nightgown and shawl, her nightcap thrown off, and her hair falling upon her shoulders, her feet in 
    slippers, tears in her eyes, but perfectly collected and dignified'" (28).  Indeed, Carey shares the public's urge to portray a weeping
    queen, a national persona full of emotion under restraint. Victoria's own recollection of the news of her uncle's death has less of the melodrama
    of her physical vulnerability, but emphasizes that she was sent into see the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Lord Chamberlain <rs 
        corresp="narrative_rhetoric" key="trope_alone">alone</rs>. 
    </p> 
	
<p>Carey's Victoria is an animated model of noble demeanor and earnest solemnity; anecdotes of the unfolding
    private and public events in this transition all confirm a providential fitness of (trained) character to occasion.

    A witness of the first Privy
    Council describes signs of emotion in a performance intended to flatten affect as a "'multitude of men'" swear allegiance to her: 
    her blush, her occasional glance "'at Melbourne for instruction'" as she studiously appears to ignore protocols of rank, greeting all graciously (Greville
    quoted in Carey 30). After the equivalent of a trial scene, she insists on being left alone in her mother's room for two hours. The narrator 
    confesses lack of omniscience, and yet all Britons claimed to know what the Queen was thinking.
    <milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_elements" ana="focalization"/>  "No one dare invade that sacred privacy; 
    but we may believe that that fair young head was bowed in earnest prayer 
	for strength and wisdom to fulfil the duty"; and as if her prayer gels into one mantra, her own moniker, Carey's invented interior monologue becomes
	"'Victoria Regina, by the grace of God,
	Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland'" (30).  Ever "instinct with the finest delicacy," the new queen wrote a letter of condolence to the widowed
	former queen, addressed to "Her Majesty the Queen," rather than "Queen Dowager": "'I will not be the first person to remind her of it'" (30)&mdash;another of 
	the speeches<milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_elements" ana="speech_subject"/> displayed like gems on velvet.</p>
	<p>Carey's narrative follows day by day and hour by hour the test<milestone unit="subject" corresp="life_events" ana="ordeal"/> of the new monarch<milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_elements" ana="temporal_effects"/>: "On the following morning, June 21st, 
	    the Queen, accompanied by her mother, drove in state to St. James's Palace. The guns in the Park 
	fired a salute at ten o'clock, and immediately the "little Queen" stood at the window of the Presence Chamber in full view of the crowd,<milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_rhetoric" ana="topos_recognition"/> 
	while the band of the Royal Guards struck up the National Anthem"; the proclamation is read aloud by the correct functionaries. The collective
	gaze takes an impression of a sacrificial figure: <rs corresp="narrative_rhetoric" key="topos_appearance">"The Queen looked very pale and fatigued. She was 
dressed in deep mourning, with a white tippet, white cuffs, and a border of white lace under a small black bonnet, which was placed far back on her 
head, exhibiting her light hair in front, simply parted over her forehead. She appeared deeply affected at the acclamations of her people, and was 
observed to shed tears" (31).</rs> <rs corresp="cbw_subject_not_featured" key="pop_chart"><rs corresp="subject_type" key="writer"><name>Elizabeth Barrett Browning</name></rs></rs> reappears in the final stanza of the poem quoted in the epigraph, here offering a blessing
that Victoria "will not weep / To wear that heavenly crown" (31).</p>
     
<p>Victoria serves to focus the collective attention as she moves into Buckingham Palace and performs her duty in Parliament.  Carey collates 
    the testimony of famous witnesses.  Thus, <rs corresp="subject_type" key="perfomer">the celebrated actress <rs corresp="cbw_subject_not_featured" key="prominent_not_pop_chart"><name>Fanny 
    Kemble</name></rs></rs> writes: <rs corresp="narrative_elements" key="topos_appearance">"The Queen is not handsome, but 
        very pretty, and the singularity of her great position lent a sentimental and poetical charm to her youthful face and figure. 
        The serene, serious sweetness of her candid brow and clear soft eyes gave dignity to the girlish countenance; 
        while the want of height only added to the effect of extreme youth of the round but slender figure, and gracefully 
        moulded hands and arms.</rs> The Queen's voice was exquisite, nor have I ever heard any spoken words more 
    musical in their gentle distinctness than 'My Lords and Gentlemen,' <milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_elements" ana="speech_subject"/>which broke the breathless silence of 
    the illustrious assembly, whose gaze was riveted on that fair flower of royalty. The enunciation was as 
    perfect as the intonation was melodious, 
    and I think it is impossible to hear a more excellent utterance than that 
    of the <milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_rhetoric" ana="trope_national_spirit"/>Queen's English by the English Queen."</p>
                    <p>Every utterance by this young woman has now become performative, likely to have the force of a vow or a law, and certainly prone to
                        be documented.  Thus, Carey recounts Victoria's first of "many deeds of mercy," the pardon of a deserter (32), followed by the vow to
                        perform a daughter's "'sacred duty'": <milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_elements" ana="speech_subject"/>"'I want to pay 
                        all that remains of my father's debts,' she said to the Prime Minister" (32).  <rs corresp="agents" key="superior"><name>Lord Melbourne</name></rs>,
                        now in loco parentis, devotes himself "to educate, instruct and form the most interesting mind and character in the world," writes George Villiers
                        to Greville, in turn quoted by Carey (33).  <milestone unit="subject" corresp="life_events" ana="talent"></milestone> <milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_elements" ana="habit"/>
                        With Melbourne's guidance, Victoria "showed that untiring industry and remarkable aptitude for business that was to set such a noble example to her subjects" (33).
                        The girl who vowed to be good institutes a daily routine the nation might safely follow (or envy).  Carey copies "a very interesting account
                        that may be quoted with profit," outlining the Queen's day in present tense that shifts to past in Carey's own words: She "'gets up soon after eight o'clock, breakfasts in her own room, 
                        and is employed the whole morning in transacting business....and has every matter of interest and importance in every department laid 
                        before her. At eleven or twelve Melbourne comes to her and stays an hour, more or less.... At two she rides with a large suite (and she 
                        likes to have it numerous); Melbourne always rides at her left hand, and the equerry-in-waiting on her right'"&mdash;a seemingly dogged gallop of state
                        for two hours "along the road"&mdash;followed by "'music and singing, playing and romping with children'" of the court.  Dinner convenes at 7:30
                        but the Queen "seldom appears before eight" (33-34). Victoria "would not allow the gentlemen to remain over their wine 
                        more than a quarter of an hour, but always remained standing in the drawing-room until they appeared. Coffee was then served, 
                        and after the Royal hostess had said a few words to each of her guests, the Duchess of Kent's 
                        whist table was arranged, the round table marshalled, Melbourne always seated at her left hand, and 
                        at half-past eleven the Queen retired" (34).</p>
                    <p>Carey's chapter shifts from reiterated actions to discriminated events, the most notable being the Queen's coronation <milestone unit="subject" corresp="history" ana="festival"/><date>June 28th, 1838</date>
                    and wedding on <date>February 10, 1840.</date>  But the familiar events consume seven remaining pages of the chapter, the details relished for their
                    pomp, romance, weight.  The coronation is "a magnificent and soul-stirring spectacle"; witnesses weep "during the long wearisome ceremonial," 
                    and choirboys shout "'Vivat Victoria Regina!," trumpets, drums, and guns resound, and the Queen and her mother are nearly overcome with 
                    emotion. The emotion did not, for some time, extend to a passionate urge to marry Albert.  Carey approves of the "noble frankness and perfect 
                    artlessness" of Victoria's retrospective
                    self-reproach for having kept the prince in suspense for years: Victoria writes, "'The only excuse the Queen can make for 
                    herself is in the fact, that the sudden change from the secluded life at Kensington to the independence of her position as Queen Regnant 
                    at the age of eighteen, put all idea of marriage out of her mind, which she now most bitterly repents.' All these maidenly doubts and scruples were to vanish, 
                    however, before the irresistible feeling inspired by the Prince when they met again" (35).  Carey relies on Victoria's letters to King 
                    Leopold and Baron Stockmar, statements of
                    private feeling clearly communicating a matter of international political concern.  The young woman feels guilty for her recent 
                    resolution not to marry, but confesses <rs corresp="narrative_elements" key="quotation_letter">"'Albert has completely won my heart, and all was settled between us this morning. ... 
                    I feel certain he will make me very happy. I wish I could say I felt as certain of making him happy, but I shall do my best'"</rs> (36).  Prince Albert's
                        own diplomatic letter to his grandmother confirms that the love was mutual; Carey interrupts excerpts of it to exclaim, "Could anything be 
                        more idyllic in its simplicity and guileless reality than 
                        this betrothal of the 'sweet Flower of May' to the princely Sir Galahad, so true to the motto of his 
                        house, '<hi rend="italics">Treu und Fest</hi>'" (37).  After an idyllic month at <rs corresp="places" key="court">Windsor Castle</rs>,
                        Albert and his brother returned home, and Victoria is reported, in correspondence between royal families, to be disconsolate. <milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_elements" ana="quotation_letter"/>
                        "There is a touching sentence in a letter of the Prince to the Duchess of Kent. 'What you say about 
                        my poor little bride sitting all alone in her room, sad and silent, has touched me to the heart. Oh, that I might fly to her 
                        side to cheer her!' And the Queen herself afterwards wrote: 'For '"the poor little bride" 
                        there was no lack of those sweet words, touched with the grateful humility of a manly love, to receive which                   
                        was a precious foretaste to her of the happiness of the years to come.' Very lover-like were the letters 
                        that came to her" (37-38). The publication of private correspondence in biography appears to have been
                    the condition of Victoria's life as she herself witnessed it, well before the posthumous recognition. Similarly, she 
                    had to present her engagement to the Privy Council and make a public Declaration of a decision based on emotions; here again 
                    she heroically controls expression of feeling in a commanding performance&mdash;thereby reassuring the government of her proper feelings.  <rs corresp="narrative_elements" key="quotation_writing_by_subject">"'I 
                    felt my hand shake, but I did not make one mistake,'"</rs> she wrote in her journal (38). The marriage is sanctioned as idyllic and guileless,
                        as it passes through procedural steps, Albert's title and annuity, the question of the wedding liturgy (to retain the word "obedience"), the matter
                        of the wedding gown's Honiton lace, her train "borne by twelve...daughters of well-known peers" (39). <milestone unit="subject" corresp="life_events" ana="marriage"/>  Witnesses described her attire and her 
                        expressions of tearful happiness and "confidence" in the <rs corresp="agents" key="husband">Prince</rs> as she uttered the vow.  The honeymoon at Windsor, Albert's sad parting from father and brother, the departure
                        of the Duchess of Kent to her own residence in turn bring Carey's narrative to a new phase: "And so the ideal married life began; 
                        the maiden monarch no longer stood <milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_rhetoric" ana="trope_alone"/>alone—she had 
                        now a strong 
                        arm on which to lean, and a 
                        discreet and faithful adviser ever beside her. No one who saw them could 
                        doubt that it was a marriage of profound happiness and true sympathy, and 
                        the good Queen had her peerless knight&mdash;<hi rend="italics">sans peur et sans reproche</hi>" (41).  The chapter concludes with quatrains of a supposed
                        song by a Scottish "peasant girl" recalling the <milestone unit="subject" corresp="history" ana="festival"/> coronation.  The tropes of appearance,
                        solitude, national spirit, shared emotion, are all condensed in the pseudo-ballad.
                    
                    </p>
                    <p>Like previous chapters in Carey's biography of Victoria, the third chapter begins with dual titles&mdash;"Married Life" and "Wife and Mother"&mdash;and a prestigious 
                        epigraph (this one from Tennyson on the good influence of Victoria as "Mother, Wife and Queen"). The marital happiness of Victoria
                        and Albert counterbalances "the trammels of etiquette and the wearisome routine and burdensome duties of a court"; "the youthful pair
                        set a noble example" <milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_rhetoric" ana="example"/>in their "industry" 
                        as well as "their method of utilising their moments of leisure"<milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_elements" ana="habit"/> (42).
                        As in the depictions of a quasi-pastoral life at the palace with the happy princess, here Carey imports eyewitness testimony, a letter quoted in a 
                        biography of Prince Albert, written by "one of the artists 
                        employed in decorating a pavilion in the garden of Buckingham Palace"; <milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_elements" ana="quotation_letter"
                   />the artist having worked for "'many royal personages'" can attest
                        to the superior character of "'our reigning Sovereign and her young and interesting husband,'" their unpretentious accessibility winning
                        "'admiration and love.  In many things they are an example to the age. They 
                        have breakfasted, had morning prayers with the household in the 
                        private chapel, and are out some distance from the Palace, talking to us in the summer-house, before half-past 
                        nine o'clock, sometimes earlier. After the public duties of the day and before their dinner they come out again, 
                        evidently delighted to get away from the bustle of the                                       
                        world to enjoy each other's society in the solitude of the garden.... Here, too, 
                        the royal children are brought out by their nurses, and the whole arrangement seems like real domestic pleasure.'
                        <rs corresp="narrative_rhetoric" ana="example">Could any description be more idyllic in its sweet simplicity? What an example to those frivolous butterflies of 
                        fashion always seeking after pleasure, and frittering away precious time and strength in their search for what 
                        they call happiness"</rs> (43-44).                   

                    </p>
                    <p>Chronology is Carey's main motivation for transition from one line to the next, but the theme of Victoria's supreme virtues
                        in contrast to "jaded worldlings" (44) brings to mind, abruptly in the next paragraph, the moral improvements of
                        the entire Victorian age.  "The Queen's influence on the stage was wonderfully beneficial; as <name>Mrs. Oliphant</name> 
                        observes, <rs corresp="narrative_elements" key="quotation_documentary">"she was in the foreground of the national life, 
                            affecting it always for good....The theatres to which she went, and which both she and her husband enjoyed, 
                            were purified by her presence; evils which had been the growth of years disappearing before the face of the young Queen"</rs> (44). This point
                        affirmed, the text moves to the birth of <rs corresp="agents" key="child_children"><name>the Princess Royal</name></rs>, on <date>November 21, 1840</date>. This
                        event invites a description of the way the Prince attended to his wife,<milestone unit="subject" corresp="agents" ana="husband"/> moving her from bed to sofa during her confinements.  
                        "As years went on, and he became overwhelmed with work <milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_elements" ana="habit"/>(for his attentions were the same in all the Queen's subsequent 
                        confinements), this was often done at much inconvenience to himself; but he ever came with a sweet smile on his face. 
                        In short, his care of her was like that of a mother, nor could there have been a kinder, wiser, or more judicious nurse" (45).
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>Knowing that the royal family is prolific and that Victoria and Albert are happy until his unexpected death, the reader
                        begins to feel that the biography of this monarch is more wearying than the duties and ceremonies of court. But perhaps
                        contemporaries took personal interest in the annals of childbirth and holidays for this family of celebrities.  The text
                        draws on correspondence and journals for glimpses of domestic life.  The <rs corresp="agents" key="child_children"><name>Prince of Wales</name></rs>
                        was born <date>November 9, 1841</date>, and christened the following January. <milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_elements" ana="quotation_writing_by_subject"/>"The Queen writes in her Journal: 'To think we have two 
                        children now, and one who enjoys the sight already (the Christmas-tree); it is like a dream.' And again, in a pretty, 
                        maternal way, 'Albert brought in dearest little Pussy (Princess Victoria) in such a smart white merino dress, trimmed with blue' and sitting together
                        as a family
                        of four gave her a feeling of happiness (45-46).  Carey presupposes Victoria's maternal devotion&mdash;"What true womanly words!"&mdash;but recent
                        biographers have recalled that Victoria's journals and letters indicate her general dislike of motherhood.
                    </p>
                    <p>A modern reader might wonder about Carey's silence on the subject of history; this is characteristic of contemporary short biographies of the 
                    Queen, which credit her with the spirit of her age but reduce that age to a few outline events.  Rather abruptly, Victoria's domestic idyll gains
                    a background of conditions of some but not all "troubles" of <date>1842</date> (famine being unmentioned). "There was terrible news from 
                        <rs corresp="places" key="nation">Afghanistan</rs>, 
                        and though the <milestone unit="subject" corresp="history" ana="international_war"/>British arms ultimately conquered, 
                        there were fearfully heavy losses.... There was also war with <rs corresp="places" key="nation">China</rs>, and the condition of things 
                        at home was most unsatisfactory, and a growing agitation on account of the corn laws.<milestone unit="subject" corresp="history" ana="mass_action"/> T
                        here were fears of a Chartist rising, and to offer a stimulus to trade the Queen gave a <hi rend="italics">bal masque</hi> at <rs corresp="places" key="court">Buckingham Palace</rs>,
                        always mentioned as 'The Queen's Plantagenet Ball.'" The impertinence of a festival of consumption (and anachronism) to address an economic
                        crisis persists in the life of Queen Victoria, with Carey's stamp of approval. </p>
                    <p> Also in <date>1842</date>, Victoria survived two assassination attempts, showing "the utmost courage," and leniency toward her attackers (47).  The Queen's
                        "first railway journey" (47) also initiates a series of journeys, particularly the holidays to Scotland, punctuating the catalogue of children
                        born and relatives died. Once the text has identified the complete series of royal children, Carey devotes some paragraphs to the theme of child-rearing and
                        education, largely through extended quotation of other biographies, such as "that charming book, 'The Private Life of the Queen,'
                        by one of Her Majesty's servants, tells us that the Queen 'always made time in her busy life to bathe with her own hands the last new baby'" (49).
                      Predictably, Victoria repeats the principles of her own upbringing, "simplicity," "discipline," sequestration from "Court life," along with
                      the employment of first-rate instructors in languages and arts, and conscientious religious training (49).
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>A surprising proportion of Victoria's biography consists of Carey's appreciation of biographies of Prince Albert, just as an undue reach of 
                    the Queen's life consisted of memorials to this paragon of men.  The Prince is praised for rising early and attending to correspondence and the 
                    business of state. He was the Queen's "truest advisor and counsellor," and she camed to "lean more on that strong arm and bright intellect" (50). It was 
                    Albert who oversaw the design and growth of the island home, Osborne. And of course it was Albert who devised the <milestone unit="subject" corresp="history" ana="festival"/>Great Exhibition, a source of 
                    joyful pride to Victoria: "'The only event it in the slightest degree reminded me of was the coronation, but this day's 
                    festival was a thousand times superior."  Victoria's writing calls the opening of the Exhibition "The proudest and happiest day of... my happy life. . . . To see this great conception of my beloved husband's mind, 
                    which is always labouring for the good of others, to see this great thought and work crowned with triumphant success" (52-53).</p>
                    <p>The awkward intermingling of family events and historical events continues to alternate through Carey's paragraphs.  In <date>1854</date>,
                        Victoria declared <rs corresp="history" key="international_war">war with Russia</rs>, a source of "consuming anxiety" (54). "The Queen 
                        suffered so keenly for her soldiers, that one of the Royal 
                        children said to Lord Cardigan, when he came to Windsor, <rs corresp="narrative_elements" key="speech_others">'You must hurry back 
                        to Sebastopol and take it, else it will kill mamma'"</rs> (54). The following paragraphs adjoin news of the birth of the last child, engagement of the first,
                        and "the awful tidings of <rs corresp="history" key="international_war">the Indian Mutiny</rs>....And again the Queen's womanly sympathies were strongly excited by the terrible details of Cawnpore.
                        On the Princess Royal's wedding day the Queen wrote in her Journal: 'The second most eventful day of my life as regards feelings. I felt as though 
                        I was being married over again myself, only much more nervous'" (54).  Perhaps biography must commit such solecisms of scale and perspective.  If 
                        your subject is a person and her experience of life, the birth of a child or the memory of feelings on her own wedding day
                        begin to claim equal discursive weight with a war, a massacre and its genocidal revenge.  It is neither the Queen's nor Carey's
                        job to tell the complete public story.</p>
                    <p>Carey's narrative raises more than one glaring mystery in spite of its polite veneer.  Why did Prince Albert fail?  The explanation, that he was
                        strained by overwork, "the sense of his responsibility as private adviser to Her Majesty," and the "'pressure which 
                        constantly compelled him to do in one day what would have been more than ample work for two'" (unidentified source; 55-56), leaves
                        doctors at the time convinced that typhoid fever, contracted in a visit to a military academy in torrential rain, caused the illness.
                        But "he had no strong yearning for life.... Not long before his fatal illness, in speaking to the Queen, he said: 
                        'I do not cling to life; you do, but I set no store by it'" (56).  Could he have wished, like many a literary if not actual wife,
                        to fade from a condition of emotional strain, living up to being the parent/spouse/advisor/friend of an imperial sovereign?  Carey 
                        synthesizes the many famous accounts of Prince Albert's illness by Victoria, Princess Alice, and other witnesses.  The chapter concludes
                        with a verse by "our glorious Poet Laureate" and these words: "'Their works do follow them.' Truly we may say of our Great Prince that 
                        his beloved name is 
                        graven indelibly on the hearts and memories 
                        of <milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_rhetoric" ana="trope_national_spirit"/> all English men and English women" (59).
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>The final chapter, "Widowhood," "A Royal Mourner," with yet another occasional verse by Tennyson, begins with an exceptional self-reference
                        by the narrator. "The writer of this sketch well remembers that melancholy Sunday, December 15th, when the omission of the Prince Consort's 
                        name from the Litany informed the congregation that their revered monarch was a widow.  A thrill ran through the church" (62). The congregation's
                        mingled prayers give way to the narrative of the queen's illness and grief, and the scene of the funeral.  The loss was collective: 
                        "Throughout the country there was long and genuine mourning for the 'blameless Prince.' 'There is no one to call me Victoria now,' the 
                        Queen is said to have exclaimed, the morning of her bereavement,—and perhaps no words could have expressed more strongly the sense of her 
                        great loneliness" (63).  Carey quotes letters and poems about the episode and Victoria's continuing period of mourning. "'For some years 
                        after the death of the Prince Consort,' as Dr. Macaulay tells us, 'the Queen appeared very little in public'" although "'no official duty 
                        as neglected.' Neither did she forget the troubles of others; for when that terrible Hartley colliery disaster occurred, by which 204 
                        miners lost their lives, Her Majesty sent a message to the effect 'that her tenderest sympathy is with the poor widows and mothers, and 
                        that her own misery only makes her feel the more for them'" (65). In response to complaints, Victoria had a letter sent to the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> to the
                        effect that she will submit to public appearances that clearly serve "'the good of her people,'" but that "there are other and higher duties than those of mere representation
                        which are now thrown on the Queen alone and unassisted,'" work that has worn her down, at the risk of making her incapable of fulfilling fundamental
                        responsibilities.  The people will not demand that she appear at every ceremony.                   
                    </p>
                   <p>And yet much of the remaining narrative is a series of ceremonies, some family weddings, some visits to hospitals, and some 
                       consecrations of statues or memorials to Albert. Meanwhile, the Queen "Queen showed her deep solicitude for her subjects 
                       by causing a letter to be written to the various directors of the railway companies, calling their attention to the increasing 
                       number of serious accidents" (68), and instituted the Albert Medal for those who saved, 
                       or endeavoured to save, the lives of others from shipwreck or other perils of the sea" (69). She 
                       opened waterworks in Aberdeen and "laid the first 
                       stone" of what became the Royal Albert Hall and for St. Thomas's Hospital, as well as attending the 
                       opening of a bridge over the Thames and new
                       buildings for the University of London (69-70).  The staging of ceremonial appearances plays an increasing role in Carey's narrative, in keeping
                       with the technological and institutional expansion of the age.  The pages of this chapter begin to resemble a log or list, often in paragraphs 
                       of a single sentence.  Children and grandchildren are married, fall ill, recover, or die; buidings are opened or memorials dedicated. Then, Carey
                       shifts tactics, condensing good deeds and years in one paragraph, quoted in part here:
                       "There were numerous other good works inaugurated by the Queen during the next few years: the laying of the foundation 
                       stone of the new Medical Examination Hall of the Royal College of 
                       Physicians and Surgeons on the Thames Embankment; the opening of the Colonial and Indian Exhibition at South 
                       Kensington, the Liverpool Exhibition, and the Royal Holloway College for Women at Mount Lee, Egham; and also 
                       of the People's Palace at the East End, in the May preceding Jubilee Day. There have been three royal 
                       jubilees in the history of England, but none of them can compare with the Jubilee of June 21st, 1887, 
                       unless it be the Jubilee of 1897, when our beloved Sovereign commemorated the sixtieth year of her reign. 
                       It was a sight that thrilled all hearts when the Queen left her palace gates that June morning, surrounded 
                       by her glorious guard of honour, sons, sons-in-law and grandsons, on her way to Westminster Abbey. 
                       The fair young Queen of fifty years before was now a grey-haired woman, but the loving heart still 
                       responded to her faithful subjects' acclamations" (74).   
                       
                   </p>  
                    <p>Here Carey returns to her earlier method of splicing together other biographical sources, as she winds up the account of the elderly 
                    Queen's life.  "There can be little doubt, as Barnett Smith tells us, that 'Her Majesty has outlived all her early friends and 
                    faithful servants. All who officiated at her coronation have passed into the land of shadows. If she has tasted all the happiness 
                    of life, she has tasted likewise its bitterness, for death has ever been busy laying his finger here and 
                    there upon her beloved friends, relatives and associates. . . . The Queen's reign is coincident with the most surprising progress 
                    at home and abroad. It has been the age of railways, of trans-oceanic steamers and of the telegraph, of free trade, parliamentary 
                    reform, and the abolition of the corn laws'" (75).  Her "firm serene rule, keen intellect, and wide sympathies" have guided
                    an age of enlightened progress and imperial expansion.  
                    </p>
                    <p>Carey repeatedly emphasizes the image of Victoria as elderly and frail.  For the sake of fresh air, she sets up an outdoor office.
                        The book "The Private Life of the Queen" is quoted as before: "'At Windsor the little Frogmore tea-house, with its lovely surroundings, 
                        is the chosen spot; and here, beneath the shade of two magnificent evergreen oaks, the Queen's writing-table and despatch-boxes are set out on fine mornings, while two mounted messengers keep up perpetual 
                        communication with the telegraph office and telephones at the Castle; and the attendant secretary stands at her side. ... 
                        In addition to the public work, the self-imposed private work done by Her Majesty is extraordinary'" (76).  Unsurpassable as correspondent,
                        the Queen makes her presence felt in letters of sympathy to the survivors of any disaster.  Further, she studies Hindustani and 
                        "the Empress of India writes her diary in that language. It has been said, 'that if the Queen had been destined to write in 
                        lieu of ruling, she must have left a great mark on the literature of the country'" (76).  Carey, perhaps less certain of power of writing 
                        unless supported by many excerpts from others' texts, concludes characteristically with a poem that is also a prayer.

                    <p>Preceding her canonization in <dateRange from="1920-01-01" to="1920-12-31"
                            >1920</dateRange>, the Victorian era experienced a revived interest in
                        the historical figure <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc</name>.
                        Because the biographical accounts written at the time reflect the various
                        ideologies of the age, one doesn’t know what to expect of her portrayal. Was
                        she illustrated as a divinely inspired prophetess or simply an imaginative
                        heroine? Universally, they regale her with flowery prose, depicting her as
                        an archetypal tragic heroine who is wronged by her contemporaries; however,
                        it seems that Victorian authors are unable to agree on the extent of her
                        holiness. Her secular self takes a back seat with her “divinity” pushed
                        beneath the spotlight in some instances, and in others the case is reversed.
                        Also, some authors comment on her adopting male conduct, wearing men’s
                        attire, and leading the men of the French military. Many authors state
                        outright what they feel to be appropriate behavior of a member of the
                        “fairer sex,” while others neglect the issue entirely. These discordant
                        viewpoints concerning <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc’s</name>
                        divinity and adherence to gender roles are reflective of the controversial
                        social issues prominent during the Victorian era.</p>
                    <p><name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc</name> was born in the <rs
                            type="place" key="country">French</rs> village <rs type="place"
                            key="village">Domrémy</rs> to <name type="father">Jacques d’Arc</name>
                        and <name type="mother">Isabelle Romée</name> in <dateRange
                            from="1412-01-01" to="1412-12-31">1412</dateRange>. Although sources
                        generally portray her childhood as a happy one, the context of <name
                            corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan’s</name> upbringing was both chaotic and
                        violent. The <rs type="place" key="country">French</rs> and the <rs
                            type="place" key="country">English</rs> were entangled in the Hundred
                        Years’ War, an international conflict that would ultimately determine the
                        future king of <rs type="place" key="country">France</rs>. After 341 years
                        of rule, the royal family line of the Capetians ended in <dateRange
                            from="1328-01-01" to="1328-12-31">1328</dateRange> leaving the <rs
                            type="place" key="country">French</rs> throne unoccupied. In a desperate
                        attempt to assume the throne amidst the controversy concerning the
                        establishment of a legitimate heir, the <rs type="place" key="country"
                            >French</rs> and the <rs type="place" key="country">English</rs> entered
                        a war that would last for over a century. <name>Charles VI</name>, during
                        one of his bouts of insanity, had signed the Treaty of <rs type="place"
                            key="city">Troyes</rs> which ensured <rs type="place">English</rs> claim
                        to the <rs type="place" key="country">French</rs> throne. <name>Charles
                            VII</name>, the Dauphin, came to be seen as an illegitimate heir, while
                        the infant <name>Henry VI</name> became the King of <rs type="place"
                            key="country">France</rs> in <dateRange from="1422-01-01"
                            to="1422-12-31">1422</dateRange>. Those still loyal to <name>Charles
                            VII</name>, however, would continue their hostile resistance against <rs
                            type="place" key="country">English</rs> occupation.</p>
                    <p><name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc</name> claimed to have experienced
                        visions from the time she was twelve, one of which included images of
                            <name>Saint Michael</name>, <name>Saint Catherine</name> and <name>Saint
                            Margaret</name> instructing her to rid <rs type="place" key="country"
                            >France</rs> of the <rs type="place" key="country">English</rs> and
                        restore the Dauphin to the throne. The means by which Victorian authors
                        attempt to explain this phenomenon are far from unanimous. For example,
                        while biographer <name>Lord Ronald Gower</name> continuously refers to
                            <name>Joan’s</name> “presences” as visions, <name>John Maskelyne</name>
                        refers to them as mere “hallucinations” and “illusions,”
                            (<name>Maskelyne</name>, 235). Biographer <name>William Adams</name> is
                        caught in the same dilemma, portraying the young <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC"
                            >Joan</name> as an impressionable child who was simultaneously directed
                        by God (<name>Adams</name>, 245-247).</p>
                    <p>In response to her visions, at sixteen years of age <name
                            corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan</name> requested that she be brought to
                            <name>Count Robert de Baudricourt</name> so that she might earn
                        permission to visit <name>Charles VII</name> at the royal court of <rs
                            type="place" key="city">Chinon</rs>. (She would have to be escorted
                        across enemy territory for the encounter with the Dauphin to take place). On
                        her second attempt she won the Count’s approval, as she managed to
                        accurately predict the result of the Battle of the Herrings.</p>
                    <p>News of <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan’s</name> visit spread quickly;
                        therefore, to test her divinity <name>Charles</name> dressed himself in
                        commoner’s clothing and adorned another in rich garb to mislead her. When
                        she arrived at court, however, she knelt before <name>Charles</name> instead
                        of the decoy, and despite <name>Charles'</name> denials, declared him the
                        true Dauphin: “‘In God’s name it is not they, but you, who are the King.
                        Most noble Dauphin, I am <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Jeanne</name> the Maid.
                        The Heavenly King sends me to help you and the realm; and to tell you that
                        you shall be anointed and crowned in the city of <rs type="place" key="city"
                            >Rheims</rs>, and that you shall reign as lieutenant of the Heavenly
                        King, who is the King of <rs type="place" key="country">France</rs>’”
                            (<name>Adams</name>, 250). Pulling him aside for a private
                        discussion—although there is no record of what was actually exchanged—she
                        managed to convince him to allow her to lead his army against the <rs
                            type="place" key="country">English</rs>.</p>
                    <p>After having been granted permission to assist in the command of the <rs
                            type="place" key="country">French</rs> army, <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC"
                            >Joan</name> deviated from traditional <rs type="place" key="country"
                            >French</rs> tactics of war and managed a series of victories against
                        the <rs type="place" key="country">English</rs>, acquiring the fortress of
                            <rs type="place" key="city">Saint Loup</rs> on <date>May 4, 1429</date>,
                        the fortress of <rs type="place" key="city">Saint Jean le Blanc</rs> on
                            <date>May 5</date>, the fortress of <rs type="place" key="city">Saint
                            Augustins</rs> on <date>May 6</date>, and on <date>May 7</date> the <rs
                            type="place" key="city">Orleans</rs> stronghold les Tourelles (an
                        achievement that left her with a wounded neck). She had another string of
                        victories in the month following, reclaiming <rs type="place" key="city"
                            >Jargeau</rs> on <date>June 12</date>, <rs type="place" key="city"
                            >Meung-sur-Loire</rs> on <date>June 15</date>, and <rs type="place"
                            key="city">Beaugency</rs> on <date>June 17</date>. She also had success
                        in the <date>June 18</date> Battle of <rs type="place" key="city"
                        >Patay</rs>, which would be the turning point of the Hundred Years’ War,
                        granting <rs type="place" key="country">France</rs> the lead against <rs
                            type="place" key="country">England</rs>. As a result of her success in
                        battle, she was able to accomplish one of the primary aims of her mission:
                        the coronation of <name>Charles VII</name> in <rs type="place" key="city"
                            >Rheims</rs> on <date>July 17</date>.</p>
                    <p>Throughout sieges, captures, and even <name>King Charles’</name> coronation,
                            <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan</name> wore the attire of a male
                        knight. Although the <rs type="place" key="country">French</rs> had
                        tolerated <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan’s</name> style of dress in her
                        campaigns, it seems that Victorian authors were unable to agree on whether
                        her transvestitism—and in a few cases her military leadership—was
                        appropriate. After having described the coronation at <rs type="place"
                            key="city">Rheims</rs>, one particular author remarks: "as the grand
                        object of her mission was now, by the will of Heaven, accomplished, she
                        entreated his permission to return home, and resume those occupations and
                        that course of life which became her sex” (<name>James</name>, 34-35). Like
                        other biographers, although he issues abundant praise for <name
                            corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan’s</name> service to her country, he still
                        adheres to Victorian ideology concerning the distinction between gender
                        roles. Another example is <name>Gower’s</name> reconstruction of <name
                            corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan’s</name> character during her trial,
                        reaffirming the Victorian perception of women as members of the fairer and
                        weaker sex: “Even <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc’s</name> courage
                        failed at that sight, and all the woman in her nature asserted itself”
                            (<name>Gower</name>, 232). <name>Gower</name> also notes that she “had
                        not the defect of so many excellent but tedious women, who love talk for the
                        mere sake of talking” (6). Other biographical accounts convey the opposite,
                        disregarding expectations of women and depicting her solely as a beacon of
                        unconquerable strength (<name>Adams</name>, 253).</p>
                    <p><name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan</name> was one of the last to leave the
                        battlefield of <rs type="place" key="city">Compiègne</rs>, resulting in her
                        imminent capture on <date>May 23rd, 1430</date>. She had led a successful
                        attack against the <rs type="place" key="country">Burgundians</rs> until the
                            <rs type="place" key="country">English</rs> intervened and attacked the
                        rear guard. Apparently, she would have made it to safety had not the
                        drawbridge to the heavily fortified town of <rs type="place" key="city"
                            >Compiègne</rs> been raised at the very last minute. She and a few of
                        her closest aides stranded outside with her were promptly taken as prisoners
                        to <rs type="place" key="city">Margny</rs>, the <rs type="place"
                            key="country">Burgundian</rs> camp. Strangely, according to
                            <name>Gower</name>, <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan</name> had at
                        certain instances demonstrated that she might have known about her fate
                        beforehand:</p>
                    <p>‘My children and dear friends, I bid you to mark that I have been sold and
                        betrayed and that I shall be shortly put to death. So I beseech you all to
                        pray to God for me, for never more shall I be able to be of service to the
                        King or to the Kingdom of <rs type="place" key="country">France</rs>’
                            (<name>Gower</name>, 126).</p>
                    <p>This appears to be another confirmation of her divinely inspired nature, as
                        portrayed by select Victorian biographers. <name>Gower</name> also makes a
                        curious statement that reflects the tendency to expound upon the “essence”
                        of the biographical subject: “This story, whether authentic or not, is
                        surely a touching one, is full of the spirit of the heroine,”
                            (<name>Gower</name>, 126). Authenticity is not as important a factor as
                        “the spirit of the heroine,” quite clearly. Any detail, as long as it
                        eulogizes the subject in some way, is worthy of documentation.</p>
                    <p>The trial, which took place in <rs type="place" key="city">Rouen</rs> from
                            <date>March 26</date> to <date>May 24, 1431</date>, was conducted by
                            <name>Pierre Cauchon</name>, Bishop of <rs type="place" key="city"
                            >Beauvais</rs> and was preceded by an interrogation lasting over fifteen
                        sessions. During interrogation, <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan</name> was
                        rigorously questioned about her birth, her religious upbringing, her
                        visions, her manly garb, her military actions and even her virginity.
                        Throughout the trial, <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan</name> famously
                        refused to swear an oath concerning the truthfulness of her answers to the
                        judges: “You may ask me questions on which I shall be able to answer you,
                        and others about which I cannot” (<name>Gower</name>, 158). After
                        interrogation <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc</name> was forced to
                        endure torture locked in an iron cage for fifty days and nights.
                        Nevertheless, she retained a great deal of dignity and mental clarity,
                        speaking shrewdly and firmly in her defense. Her courage is certainly
                        exalted in Victorian biography; for every factual detail there is a comment
                        on her virtue and bravery. In one instance, <name>Gower</name> exclaims,
                        “Glorious words, worthy of her who spoke them! They bear with them a heroic
                        ring, and reveal with one sublime expression the very soul and spirit of
                            <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc</name>!” (192). Rousing,
                        majestic expressions like “sublime” and “heroic” add to the already
                        larger-than-life qualities attributed to her. Her noble character is
                        contrasted with those of her captors, who are depicted as dastardly and
                        devoid of morals: “No doubt can be entertained that she was a sacrifice to
                        jealousy, in the first place, leaving hypocrisy and cruelty to do their part
                        in the course of her trial--that mockery of justice and everlasting disgrace
                        to all who bore a part in it” (<name>James</name>, 43). This line
                        illustrates the sharp polarization of good and evil in these Victorian
                        accounts. The sweeping descriptions “sacrifice to jealousy” and “everlasting
                        shame and infamy” have a sense of permanence that coincides with the
                        prevalent religious overtone. There seems to be a clear delineation between
                        the holy and the blasphemous.</p>
                    <p>The conclusion to the dramatic trial was her iconic, romanticized execution.
                            <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc</name> was condemned to burn at
                        the stake on <date>May 30, 1431</date>, only six days after the trial ended.
                        She was bullied into signing an abjuration stating that she would either
                        wear women’s clothes or immediately burn at the stake. She was sexually
                        assaulted only days after the abjuration and the perpetrators stole her
                        clothes and left her with nothing to cover herself but men’s attire. When
                        the Bishop noticed her garb, he immediately called for a meeting at the
                        archiepiscopal chapel on the <date>29th of May</date> in which all condemned
                        her to death.</p>
                    <p>She died beautifully, firmly clutching a crude cross made of staves as the
                        flames consumed her. Of course, Victorian biographers capitalized on the
                        dramatic nature of her death, by exaggerating her heroic and Christ-like
                        characteristics: “The crime of her martyrdom will ever rest, and surely no
                        other crime but one in the world’s history can be paralleled with it”
                            (<name>Gower</name>, 252). Yet not all of them are overwhelmed by
                        religious overtones. Biographer <name>George James</name>, for example, is a
                        lot more secular in his approach: “In an enlightened age, her transcendently
                        noble qualities, which were displayed in the best of causes, the just
                        defence of her king and country, would have secured her universal admiration
                        and gratitude; nor perhaps, can ancient or modern history furnish an example
                        of such pure and exalted heroism” (<name>James</name>, 62). This text in
                        particular focuses on her personal bravery and attitude rather than her
                        divinity. Also, the author takes the opportunity to opine on the superiority
                        of his own enlightened era, and does not refer to any form of spirituality.
                        The biographies’ dissonant portrayals of <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC"
                            >Joan</name> as either a heroic or divine figure (and in some instances
                        a blend of the two) echo the conflict between faith and secularism prominent
                        in Victorian society.</p>
                    <p>From the differing depictions and viewpoints of these biographies, one can
                        easily observe the extent to which Victorians diverged from one another in
                        social ethics and belief systems. <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of
                            Arc</name>, a focused straightforward character, is poked and prodded in
                        multiple directions by these authors. To some she is a true messenger of
                        God, and to others she is merely a brave soul with an excitable imagination.
                        Their biographies hold up a looking glass to an age when people simply could
                        not decide whether to be spiritual or enlightened, whether to enforce gender
                        roles or to blur the lines. However, these accounts undividedly devote
                        themselves to eulogizing <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan</name> and making
                        it abundantly clear that her nature and deeds were to be venerated by
                        all.</p>

                            >Fanny</name> ultimately saved her own family through her caricature of

                            <name>Mary</name> was during those five years, the majority of family

                        the closest resemblance of her two siblings to her father
                            (<name>Neville-Sington</name>, <rs type="place" key="city">Oxford</rs>
                        Dictionary). A vicar by trade, <name>William</name> possessed a keen
                        predilection for science, mathematics, and inventing, and he “preferred
                        inventing gadgets to saving souls” (<name>Neville-Sington</name>, <rs
                            type="place" key="city">Oxford</rs> Dictionary). Both <name

                        incapacity for idleness, an inclination for math and mending, and a certain
                        rashness. While other girls were busy sewing, <name

                        pleasant persona, made her a delight in society, among friends, and to her

                            (<name>Trollope</name>, 42). Unfortunately, farming did not agree with

                        agricultural expertise, along with the unexpected denial of his uncle’s

                    <p><name corresp="FRANCES_TROLLOPE">Fanny</name> maintained her Victorian
                        stoicism in her lack of outward reaction to their dire circumstances. In her

                            <name>Thomas's</name> temper and virtually no mention of the
                            <name>Trollopes'</name> financial problems. <name
                            corresp="FRANCES_TROLLOPE">Fanny</name> only revealed her feelings and
                        family life in her later novels, in which she devised stories of strained
                        husband-wife and husband-son relationships with the knowledge of someone who
                        had personally experienced such tension and sorrow. Her novel <hi
                            rend="italics">One Fault</hi> traces the breakdown of a marriage, while
                        spousal verbal abuse is prevalent in <hi rend="italics">Romance of

                            corresp="FRANCES_TROLLOPE">Fanny</name> writes, “We are often told that
                        the first falling in love is an important epoch in existence… Perhaps the

                        produce a great change.” Through a rather cathartic writing style, <name
                            corresp="FRANCES_TROLLOPE">Fanny</name> drew strength from her anger
                            (<name>Neville-Sington</name>, <name corresp="FRANCES_TROLLOPE">Fanny

                        also proved she could think independently from her husband, and relied upon
                        her female friends as her husband became more of a distant stranger. The
                        friendships <name corresp="FRANCES_TROLLOPE">Fanny</name> developed at <rs
                            type="place" key="city">Harrow</rs> proved invaluable, and through these

                            >Fanny</name> the idea of an <rs type="place" key="country"
                            >American</rs> excursion. <name>Wright</name> and her sister had plans

                        to begin to reform the education of Afican American children. When

                        occupation for the young man; the family’s financial state would not allow

                            >Parisian</rs> office. However, the city proved too much for

                            (<name>Trollope</name>, 77-85).</p>
                    <p><name>Fanny</name> came to view <rs type="place" key="country">America</rs>
                        as an opportunity to mend multiple issues: in <rs type="place" key="country"
                            >America</rs> she could cheaply educate <name>Henry</name> (as well as

                        speculative scheme of the bazaar. Monetarily, the family emerged in worse
                        debt, mostly due to the failed bazaar. <name corresp="FRANCES_TROLLOPE"

                        experience with Fanny Wright's utopian scheme and the dreary cultural
                        climate Trollope perceived in Cincinnati and elsewhere transformed her
                        views; she returned to <rs type="place" key="country">England</rs> fiercely
                        opposed to democracy and to its resulting “universal degradation”
                            (<name>Pope-Hennessy</name>, 107). Such vehemence is readily apparent in

                        importantly from themselves. Regardless of what some saw as her questionable
                        morality, her book became an instant success and even spawned the verb “to
                        trollopise,” meaning to sermonize on experiences
                        (<name>Pope-Hennessy</name>, 16). Many <rs type="place" key="country"
                            >Americans</rs> and <rs type="place" key="continent">Europeans</rs>
                        alike attacked <name corresp="FRANCES_TROLLOPE">Mrs. Trollope</name>,
                        professing: “Although <name corresp="FRANCES_TROLLOPE">Mrs. Trollope</name>

                            >Trollope’s</name> earnings. In the decade following the publication of

                        often worked on multiple books at once, and continued to write through the

                            <name corresp="FRANCES_COBBE">Frances Power Cobbe</name> was in many
                        ways a remarkable woman. Living in the Victorian age when women had limited

                    <p><name corresp="FRANCES_COBBE">Frances Power Cobbe</name> began exercising her
                        philanthropic spirit at an early age. The only daughter of <name

                            >Charles Cobbe</name>, she was born into a landowning Anglo-Irish family
                        of some wealth and distinction. <name corresp="FRANCES_COBBE">Cobbe</name>
                        therefore had a comfortable middle-class upbringing, and it provided her
                        with opportunities to help those in need. On her father’s <rs type="place"
                            key="estate">Newberry</rs> estate, for example, lived poor <rs

                            <name>Deidre Rafferty</name>, in a short biography of <name

                            corresp="FRANCES_COBBE">Cobbe</name> there was a sense of duty and
                        obligation towards the less fortunate. It was possibly this same sense of
                        duty and obligation that influenced and compelled her interest in reform
                        movements. In her autobiography <hi rend="italics">Life of <name

                        a motivation in regards to her interest in the campaign against domestic
                        violence: “in <dateRange from="1878-01-01" to="1878-12-31">1878</dateRange>
                        I was by chance reading a newspaper in which a series of frightful cases of

                        myself: ‘I will never rest till I have tried what I can do to stop this'”

                            Women</hi> that “it is quite possible to erect a general scheme of duty
                        on the sole ground of the inherent necessary rightfulness of one class of
                        actions and sentiments, and wrongfulness of another…” (29).</p>
                    <p>As the only daughter in a family of five children, <name

                        suggests that the minimal inheritance “indicated that her father had not

                        vivisection. <name corresp="FRANCES_COBBE">Cobbe</name> saw feminism and the
                        anti-vivisection movement as inextricably linked. Both movements sought to

                            >Cobbe</name> believed adamantly in the autonomy of women, but also
                        believed in innate differences between the sexes. Though she campaigned for
                        rights for women, she also upheld the traditional view of feminine traits
                        like purity and tenderness. This might appear to be a contradiction today,
                        and even at the time of <name corresp="FRANCES_COBBE">Cobbe’s</name> death
                        her breed of feminism was somewhat old-fashioned. Even though her writing

                                Mary Somerville Library, founded by a women's literary group (the
                                Mary Somerville Library Society) in 1876. The article provides a
                                background of the historical library located in Mound City, KS,
                                including the significance of its name. Linked through the Mound

                    <p><name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary Somerville</name> was an outstanding
                        mathematician and scientist of the Victorian period. Her scientific
                        contributions were doubly significant: not only was she a woman working
                        within a predominantly male domain, but modern science itself was a
                        fledgling field struggling to claim a place in Victorian culture. <name
                            corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary Somerville’s</name> enlightened work
                        helped to establish science as a distinct area of study in <rs type="place"
                            key="kingdom">Britain</rs>, and by the time of her death she was
                        well-known throughout <rs type="place" key="continent">Europe</rs> for both
                        her prodigious mathematical talents and her modest, polite, zealously
                        self-motivated personality. Curiously, <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE"
                            >Mary</name> was not a proficient reader until her early teens, and
                        encountered her first algebraic problem only by chance. Despite the many
                        objections from those attempting to deter her, and entirely through her own
                        efforts and determination, she became an internationally renowned authority
                        on emerging sciences, including physics and geography. </p>
                    <p><name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary Fairfax</name> was born on
                            <date>December 26, 1780</date>, not in her own home, but in that of her
                        mother’s sister. Her father was a vice-admiral in the <rs type="place"
                            key="kingdom">British</rs> Navy, sent to sea as a midshipman at scarcely
                        ten years of age. As he was so often absent, <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE"
                            >Mary’s</name> mother had decided to accompany him to his port of
                        departure in <rs type="place" key="city">London</rs>. In the throes of her
                        confinement, <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary’s</name> mother arrived at
                        her sister’s house in <rs type="place" key="town">Jedburgh</rs>, <rs
                            type="place" key="country">Scotland</rs> just in time to give birth to
                            <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name>. As <name
                            corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary’s</name> mother was ill following her
                        delivery, she was nursed by her aunt <name>Martha</name>, who also happened
                        to be the mother of her future husband (<name>Neeley</name> 23).</p>
                    <p><name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> grew up in <rs type="place"
                            key="kingdom">Fife</rs>, <rs type="place" key="country">Scotland</rs>,
                        in the “quiet, quaint little seaport village” (<name>Osen</name> 96) of <rs
                            type="place" key="town">Burntisland</rs>. The <name>Fairfax</name> house
                        and garden were close to the seashore, and <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE"
                            >Mary</name> spent much of her youth roaming the hillsides and coast
                        near her home, practically ignorant of the existence of mathematics. She
                        wrote in her autobiography: “I never cared for dolls, and had no one to play
                        with me” (<name>Somerville</name> 18), and her solitary wanderings
                        cultivated her profound fascination with nature. This lifelong love of
                        nature was fueled by her devout faith in God, as her mother, according to
                            <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary’s</name> own account, “taught me to
                        read the Bible, and to say my prayers morning and evening; otherwise she
                        allowed me to grow up a wild creature” (<name>Somerville</name> 17). Her
                        father, upon returning home from one of his long voyages, was dismayed to
                        find her such a “savage,” hardly able to read or write at ten years of age,
                        and he immediately sent her to a fashionable boarding school in <rs
                            type="place" key="town">Musselburgh</rs> (<name>Osen</name> 97), though
                            <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> was “utterly wretched” there
                            (<name>Somerville</name> 21) and only remained for one year.</p>
                    <p>After her brief sojourn in formal education, <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE"
                            >Mary</name> returned home to <rs type="place" key="town"
                            >Burntisland</rs> and assumed control over her own education. She
                        studied Latin, arithmetic, and writing, with only the aid of her own
                        resourcefulness. In her mid-teens, the disapproval of her
                        traditionally-minded family supplanted <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE"
                            >Mary’s</name> ever-increasing appetite for education, and she was
                        forced to spend more of her time learning domestic arts. She became quite
                        proficient in playing piano, drawing, and needlework, and had an active
                        social life. It was at a tea party that she encountered her very first
                        algebra problem. <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> and a friend
                        were flipping through a fashion magazine when she spotted some algebraic
                        symbols that kindled her interest, and she resolved to investigate the
                        subject further (<name>Osen</name> 99 – 100). Although unassertive by
                        nature, <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> eventually managed to
                        obtain and study a copy of <name>Euclid’s</name> Elements of Geometry
                        despite familial reproach. Indeed, “her mother was appalled and shamed by
                        such aberrant behavior, and the servants were instructed to confiscate <name
                            corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary’s</name> supply of candles so that she
                        could not study at night” (<name>Osen</name> 102).</p>
                    <p>In <dateRange from="1804-01-01" to="1804-12-31">1804</dateRange>, <name
                            corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> married her cousin <name>Samuel
                            Greig</name>, a captain in the <rs type="place" key="country"
                            >Russian</rs> Navy. Though he had already served with distinction, <name
                            corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary’s</name> parents would not hear of her
                        moving to <rs type="place" key="country">Russia</rs>, so <name>Samuel</name>
                        left active service and became the <rs type="place" key="country"
                            >Russian</rs> consol for <rs type="place" key="kingdom">Britain</rs> in
                            <rs type="place" key="city">London</rs> (<name>Patterson</name> 3).
                        Finally removed from the intellectual confines of her conservative family’s
                        criticism, <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> was less inhibited in
                        her mathematical studies, though not by much. In the words of her daughter
                            <name>Martha</name>, “nothing can be more erroneous than the statement…
                        that <name>Mr. Greig</name> (<name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary's</name>
                        first husband) aided her in her mathematical and other pursuits. Nearly the
                        contrary was the case. <name>Mr. Greig</name> took no interest in science or
                        literature, and possessed in full the prejudice against learned women which
                        was common at that time” (<name>Somerville</name> 3). Of the two children
                        she had with <name>Samuel</name>, one died at the age of seven and the
                        other, <name>Woronzow Greig</name>, grew up to be a barrister-at-law. After
                        just three years of marriage, <name>Samuel</name> died in <dateRange
                            from="1807-01-01" to="1807-12-31">1807</dateRange>, leaving <name
                            corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> grief-stricken and unhealthy for
                        several years.</p>
                    <p> Not having found London particularly agreeable, <name
                            corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> returned to <rs type="place"
                            key="town">Burntisland</rs> after her first husband's death. Financially
                        independent for the first time in her life, <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE"
                            >Mary</name> was at liberty to pursue her study of mathematics in
                        earnest. Her interest in nature emboldened her and she also began to study
                        astronomy and natural science. She continued to advance her scientific
                        knowledge, slowly acquiring a small library as well as professional advice.
                        In <dateRange from="1812-01-01" to="1812-12-31">1812</dateRange> she married
                        another cousin, a surgeon named <name>William Somerville</name>, with whom
                        she had three children, though only two survived infancy. In contrast to the
                        behavior of her first husband, <name>Dr. William Somerville</name> was
                        entirely supportive of <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary’s</name> efforts
                            (<name>Osen</name> 105). In the early days of their marriage the couple
                        divided their time between <rs type="place" key="country">Scotland</rs> and
                            <rs type="place" key="city">London</rs>, and as their <rs type="place"
                            key="city">London</rs> residence was near the Royal Institution of <rs
                            type="place" key="kingdom">Great Britain</rs>, <name
                            corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> was able to use its vast resources
                        to further educate herself. <name>Dr. Somerville’s</name> connections with
                        the <rs type="place" key="kingdom">British</rs> government incorporated the
                            <name>Somervilles</name> into an animatedly intellectual social circle,
                        and <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> met and befriended many
                        leading mathematicians and astronomers. Though she spent much of her day in
                        private study, her daughter <name>Martha</name> wrote that <name
                            corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> found “gay and cheerful company… a
                        pleasant relaxation after a hard day’s work. My mother never introduced
                        scientific or learned subjects into general conversation. When they were
                        brought forward by others, she talked simply and naturally about them,
                        without the slightest pretension to superior knowledge”
                            (<name>Somerville</name> 5).</p>
                    <p>The same humility with which her daughter credited her was reflected in her
                        scientific work. <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> soon became
                        well-known for her comprehensible writing style, despite the complexity of
                        the subject matter, and for her desire to “make the laws by which the
                        material world is governed, more familiar” (<name>Osen</name> 113). <name

                        individuals. Despite others’ confidence in her ability, <name
                            corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> was hesitant and undertook the
                        translation in secrecy in order to assure that her work could be destroyed
                        if it were a failure (<name>Osen</name> 107). In her own modest words, she
                        stated that “I simply translated <name>Laplace’s</name> work from algebra
                        into common language.” The <rs type="place" key="country">English</rs>
                        scientist <name>Sir John Herschel</name> immediately proclaimed the work “a
                        book for posterity” because of Mary’s ability to clearly communicate
                        concepts through simple explications entirely lacking condescension (<name
                            corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> 570). Upon publication, it became
                        an extremely popular mathematical resource, and quickly became a textbook
                        for <rs type="place" key="city">Cambridge</rs> University mathematics

                        however, and wrote a second book, On the Connexion of the Physical Sciences.

                            key="country">American</rs> editions. This second book was a detailed
                        account of physical phenomena and the many connections among the fields of
                        physical science (<name>Grinstein</name> and <name>Campbell</name> 212). In
                        its first four decades, some fifteen thousand copies of her book were sold,
                        and the tenth edition appeared in <dateRange from="1877-01-01"

                        conversation, that they were delighted with each other. He was later
                        bewildered when his friend believed herself to be the victim of a joke,
                        indignantly challenging him, “How could you do so? You knew that I did not

                        another book, Physical Geography. The pioneering work proved to be yet

                        “a regional approach to geography rather than one made solely along national
                        or political lines” (<name>Patterson</name> 194). It was used extensively in
                        schools and universities for the next fifty years (<name>Grinstein</name>
                        and <name>Campbell</name> 214), and five more editions appeared in her
                        lifetime for a total of approximately sixteen thousand copies sold

                        Molecular and Microscopic Science. It was published four years later in two
                        volumes, the first delving into “small bodies of inanimate matter
                        (molecules)” and the second dealing with “small bodies of animate matter
                        (microscopic organisms)” (<name>Patterson</name> 194). By the time of its
                        publication, however, much of its subject matter was already obsolete, and
                        the reviewers paid more attention to her age and distinction than to the
                        contents. At the seasoned age of eighty-nine, <name

                        daughter <name>Martha</name>. Personal Recollections, published posthumously
                        by her daughter, decidedly omitted distinctly scientific portions of the
                        manuscript, in addition to specific references to people and events deemed
                        uninteresting or inappropriate in context (<name>Grinstein</name> and

                        361). She became deaf and weak in her final years, though she continued
                        nonetheless in her perpetual dedication to self-improvement. Her mind
                        remained intact and she would “read books on the higher algebra for four or
                        five hours in the morning, even to solve problems” (<name>Perl</name> 92).
                        She died peacefully at the age of ninety-two, and up until the day she died
                        she worked on math problems to amuse herself (<name>Patterson</name> 195).

                        beautiful as well as the exquisite loveliness of minute objects. Above all,
                        in the laws which science unveils, step by step, she found ever renewed
                        motives for the love and adoration of their Author and Sustainer”

                        twenty-eight-year-old <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Adelaide Anne
                            Procter</name> wrote a letter describing a peasant’s engagement party
                        she had attended in <rs type="place" key="country">Italy</rs>:</p>
                    <p>"We have been to a ball, of which I must give you a description. Last
                        Tuesday… we heard very distinctly a band of music, which rather excited my
                        astonishment… <name>Emily</name> said, ‘Oh! That band is playing at the
                        farmer’s near here. The daughter is fiancée to-day, and they have a ball.’ I
                        said, ‘I wish I was going!’ ‘Well,’ replied she, ‘the farmer’s wife did call
                        to invite us.’ ‘Then, I shall certainly go,’ I exclaimed… We were received
                        with great enthusiasm; the only drawback being, that no one spoke French… I
                        began to be afraid that some idea of our dignity might prevent my getting a
                        partner; so, by <name>Madame B.’s</name> advice, I went up to the bride, and
                        offered to dance with her… My [other] partner was a little man, like
                            <name>Perrot</name>, and very proud of his dancing. He cut in the air
                        and twisted about, until I was out of breath, though my attempts to imitate
                        him were feeble in the extreme… after seven or eight dances, I was obliged
                        to sit down. We stayed till nine, and I was so dead beat with the heat that
                        I could hardly crawl about the house… it is so long since I have danced.”
                            –<name>Dickens</name>, xvii-xix</p>
                    <p><name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Adelaide Anne Procter’s</name> exuberance in
                        this anecdote conflicts with the general impression of a severe or
                        meditative character, reflected in her role as a poet, advocate for women’s
                        rights, and member of a prominent literary family. A friend of the family
                        described the young <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter</name> as
                        possessing a “doomed” look about her, manifested in a “marked brow over
                        heavy blue eyes" and a “mournful expression for a little child”
                            (<name>Gregory</name>, Life and Work [LW], 5). However, <name>Charles
                            Dickens</name> provides us with a contrasting view of <name
                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> character as he writes that
                        even on her deathbed “her old cheerfulness never quitted her”
                            (<name>Dickens</name>, xxiii). Though <name>Dickens</name> proved to be
                        a prominent advocate for <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter</name> and
                        her works, one must wonder what he saw in the young lady that few others
                        did. These markedly different perceptions of <name
                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Adelaide Anne Procter’s</name> personality
                        only begin to relate all the ways she was, and is today, perceived by
                        critics and friends alike. </p>
                    <p><name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Adelaide</name> was born into the
                            <name>Procter</name> family in <rs type="place" key="city">London</rs>
                        on <date>October 30, 1825</date>, and she “grew up amid surroundings
                        calculated to develop her literary taste” (<name>Lee</name>, 1). Many family
                        friends perceived that she had a serious demeanor, as they would have
                        expected of the daughter of a well-respected poet. Her father, <name>Bryan
                            Waller Procter</name>, who published under the name <name>Barry
                            Cornwall</name>, was a lawyer and a poet so well regarded that he has
                        prominent placement in several short obituaries of his daughter. <name
                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> mother encouraged her
                        daughter’s interest in poetry by copying poems into a small album, which the
                        young girl carried “about like another little girl might have carried a
                        doll” (<name>Dickens</name>, xvi). <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER"
                            >Procter</name> grew up surrounded by important figures of literature
                        and reform, such as <name>William Makepeace Thackery</name>, <name>Charles
                            Dickens</name>, <name>Thomas Carlyle</name>, and <name>M. P. Benjamin
                            Leigh Smith</name> (<name>Hoeckley</name>, 2); however, as her
                        experience at the engagement party documents, she also enjoyed associating
                        with people outside her elite circle, and took pleasure in non-literary
                        pursuits.</p>
                    <p>Despite <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> familiarity with
                        the literary world, she refused to rely on her connections as she sought
                        publication. She even submitted her poetry to <name>Dickens’</name>
                        publication, Household Words, under the pseudonym “<name>Miss
                        Berwick</name>” (2). Her use of a female name (unlike authors such as
                            <name>Marian Evans</name> and the <name corresp="CHARLOTTE_BRONTE"
                            >Brontë</name> sisters who used masculine pen names) can be seen as an
                        early indication of her later campaigns for women’s rights, becaue she
                        promoted women’s entrance into the male-dominated sphere of publication.
                            <name>Dickens</name> himself was unaware that <name>Miss Berwick</name>,
                        whose poetry he frequently published, was actually <name
                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Adelaide Anne Procter</name>, the daughter of
                        a long-time family friend. One winter day in <dateRange from="1854-01-01"
                            to="1854-12-31">1854</dateRange>, as he visited with the
                            <name>Procter</name> family, he warmly praised the unknown female poet
                        whose work he had been publishing for two years (2). The following evening,
                        he learned that he had been praising “<name>Miss Berwick</name>” in her
                        presence (2). Until then, <name>Dickens</name> and the Household Words staff
                        had fantasized that this mysterious <name>Miss Berwick</name> was a
                        governess. He had so fully invented her character that his “mother was not a
                        more real personage to [him], than <name>Miss Berwick</name> the governess
                        became” (<name>Dickens</name>, xiv), but he transferred his admiration for
                            “<name>Miss Berwick</name>” to <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Miss
                            Procter</name>. Her use of a pseudonym “strikingly illustrates the
                        honesty, independence, and quiet dignity, of the lady’s character” (xiv-xv)
                        because she relied on her talent, rather than her connections, to advance

                            >Procter’s</name> poetry continued after he discovered her identity, and
                        over time she became his most published author (<name>Gregory</name>, <name
                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">A. Procter</name>, 1). <name>Dickens</name>
                        published her poetry not only in Household Words, but also All the Year
                        Round, another of his well-circulated periodicals (<name>Hoeckley</name>, 2;
                            <name>Lee</name>, 1). Although very few periodicals besides
                            <name>Dickens’</name> featured her work (<name>Drain</name>, 2), she had
                        ample opportunity to publish her poetry through <name>Dickens</name>. She
                        was the only poet whom he featured in his Christmas edition.
                            (<name>Gregory</name>, LW, 228). She published her own two-volume book
                        of poetry, Legends and Lyrics, in <dateRange from="1858-05-01"
                            to="1858-01-31">May of 1858</dateRange>, and both volumes were reprinted
                        in multiple editions. </p>
                    <p>Although <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter</name> found professional
                        success as an artist, her poetic ability is only one of many traits
                        distinguishing her from most Victorian women. She was raised as a
                        Protestant, but she and her sisters converted to Catholicism in <dateRange
                            from="1851-01-01" to="1851-12-31">1851</dateRange>, possibly influenced
                        by an Italian aunt (<name>Hoeckley</name>, 2). This conversion is
                        significant: given the strong anti-Catholic sentiments throughout <rs
                            type="place" key="country">England</rs> at this time, her conversion
                        shows strength of character. Some scholars speculate, however, that she had
                        already secretly adopted Catholicism two years earlier (<name>Drain</name>,
                        2), when she was twenty-four. <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER"
                            >Adelaide</name>may have waited to announce her decision until she had
                        her sisters’ support because her conversion complicated the initially strong
                        relationship between herself and her father (<name>Gregory</name>, LW, 10).
                        But whether she feared cultural or familial disapproval, her delay may
                        detract from her iconic position as an independent woman. However, her
                        Catholic faith led her directly to passionate involvement with social work,
                        arguably one of her most progressive achievements.</p>
                    <p>Because of widespread bigotry against Catholics, <name
                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> conversion aligned her with
                        oppressed sectors of society, including working-class <rs type="place"
                            key="country">Irish</rs> Catholics (11). She supported the Providence
                        Row Night Refuge, which aided predominantly Catholic homeless women and
                        children (11). Her concern for the disenfranchised also led her to the
                        struggle for women’s rights, a cause she championed throughout her life. She
                        associated with other women who combined their artistic and cultural
                        interests with the advancement of women’s causes. These women frequently met
                        in each other’s homes to discuss marriage and property laws in the context
                        of women’s lives (<name>Hoeckley</name>, 3). Though they often met sexist
                        criticism meant to trivialize their cause (3), that attention also indicated
                        that their ideas posed a threat to the societal status quo.</p>
                    <p><name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter</name> used her success as a poet to
                        advance the causes for which she fought. Beyond writing for personal
                        enjoyment, she also dedicated her literary efforts to helping women in the
                        workplace. She united her passions for writing and reform through her work
                        in The <rs type="place" key="country">English</rs> Woman’s Journal, which
                        fought for women’s equality in education, employment, and property rights
                        (3). She used her poetic skills to provide a voice for the Catholic widows
                        and orphans she was helping through the Providence Row Night Refuge. While
                        working to support the Society to Promote the Employment of Women (SPEW),
                        she published <title>
                            <hi rend="italics">Victoria Regia: a Volume of Original Contributions in
                                Poetry and Prose</hi>
                        </title> (3-4). This publication supported the cause of female employment by
                        using a printing company which exclusively employed women (4). <name
                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> poetic success was not only
                        a personal victory, but also a way for her to advance her belief in social
                        justice.</p>
                    <p>Despite her prolific publication, critical reception of her poetry was and
                        remains highly ambivalent. Even <name>Dickens</name>, <name
                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> most enthusiastic advocate,
                        was uneasy about the social aspects of her poetry. While declaring his
                        admiration for her style, he evinced some apprehension about those social
                        aspects (<name>Gregory</name>, LW, 197). He praised her philanthropic work
                        but avoided mentioning her official positions within liberal organizations
                        (197). Beyond her possibly controversial topics, a contemporary biographer
                        writes that her style of poetry was often “not only sentimental but also
                        formally simplistic” (<name>Hoeckley</name>, 5). <name>Procter</name>
                        herself admitted that “Papa is a poet. I only write verses”
                            (<name>Drain</name>, 3). Despite its formal uninventiveness, her poetry
                        was popular because of its “invariably simple and direct language and
                        strongly affective rhetoric. This simplicity… masks a complexity of thought
                        and feeling” (<name>Gregory</name>, LW, 3-4). Critiques of her work,
                        accompanied with <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> own
                        humility, suggest that her poetry’s significance comes from its content
                        rather than its form or style.</p>
                    <p><name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> relationships within
                        feminist societies have led to speculations about her sexuality. Little is
                        known about her romantic and sexual liaisons. She was engaged at least once,
                        according to a letter from <name>William Makepeace Thackeray</name>, and
                        there is additional evidence that she was engaged to a man who devastated
                        her by breaking the engagement (21, 24). This latter incident probably
                        occurred two years before the <name>Thackeray</name> letter, although the
                        dating and details are so uncertain that this may be the same man (21, 24).
                        Despite these documented heterosexual relationships, rumors of her
                        lesbianism have persisted. Her friendship with <name>Matilda M. Hays</name>,
                        a co-editor of The <rs type="place" key="country">English</rs> Woman’s
                        Journal, may not have been platonic: “She dedicated the ‘First Series’ of
                        Legends and Lyrics to ‘<name>Matilda M. Hays</name>’. On the <date>23
                            January 1858</date>
                        <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter</name> wrote a poem titled ‘To
                        M.M.H’…It is a poem which expresses love for <name>Hays</name>… who dressed
                        in men’s clothes and had lived with [a woman] in <rs type="place" key="city"
                            >Rome</rs>” (24-25). Other than the vaguely erotic nature of several of
                        her poems (254), there is little evidence about her romantic or sexual
                        life.</p>
                    <p>The intense activity and ceaseless work that made <name
                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter</name> remarkable contributed to her
                        early death at the age of thirty-eight. She was confined to her bed for the
                        last fifteen months of her short life as she suffered from tuberculosis. It
                        is highly possible that her work among the sick exposed her to the
                        tuberculosis that killed her, although her intense work ethic rendered her
                        physically ill-equipped to fight the disease (<name>Hoeckley</name>, 5). She
                        died in the presence of her mother and sister in <rs type="place" key="city"
                            >London</rs> at the age of thirty-eight (<name>Dickens</name>,
                        xxiv).</p>
                    <p>Despite her passionate activism, her obituaries hailed her importance as a
                        poet and as her father’s literary heir. Her obituary in The Examiner lists
                        her poetic achievements with no mention of her social importance (The
                        Examiner). It fallaciously states that she died unexpectedly, despite her
                        fifteen months on bed rest (The Examiner). Her obituary in <rs type="place"
                            key="city">Liverpool</rs> Mercury Etc. falsely reports that she died “at
                        about thirty years of age” (<rs type="place" key="city">Liverpool</rs>).
                        Both of these inconsistencies romanticize her premature death. In another
                        obituary, published by an <rs type="place" key="country">Irish</rs>
                        newspaper, <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> Catholic faith
                        is celebrated above her achievements; the author claims that “The religious
                        no less than the literary world has good cause to lament [her] loss”
                        (Freeman’s). These early accounts of her life omit her social reform, while
                        contemporary biographers emphasize her importance as a woman’s advocate
                        above her merit as a poet. As society has recognized the importance of
                        women’s rights, this aspect of <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER"
                            >Procter’s</name> life has been more celebrated. These different
                        perceptions are possible because <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER"
                            >Procter</name> was such a rich character, with a young woman’s
                        cheerfulness, a poet’s intensity, an artistic vision, and a passion for
                        reform. </p>

                    </head>
                    <p>At the dawn of the Victorian Era, one diminutive but brave young woman
                        captivated the national consciousness as a result of her role in a dangerous
                        rescue mission off the coast of <rs type="place" key="county"
                            >Northumberland</rs>. Her name was <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace
                            Darling</name>, and through her efforts in the rescue of nine
                        shipwrecked passengers early on the morning of <date>September 7,
                            1838</date>, she was transformed into an exalted national hero. She was
                        both lauded and hounded by the public up until her early death, after which
                        she, and her story, continued to entrance the public imagination in Britain
                        and abroad.</p>
                    <p><name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace Horsley Darling</name> was born in <rs
                            type="place" key="village"/>Bamburgh, <rs type="place" key="county"
                            >Northumberland</rs> on <date>November 14, 1815</date>, and was the
                        seventh of <name>William</name> and <name>Thomasin Darling’s</name> nine
                        children. <name>William Darling</name> was a lighthouse keeper, as his
                        father had been before him, and <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>
                        and her siblings grew up on the “Longstone Light on one of the wild and
                        savage <rs type="place" key="archipelago"/>Farne islands”
                            (<name>Sitwell</name> 59). Relatively little is known regarding <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name> early years, though she seems to
                        have received a solid education evident in her handwriting, which was “equal
                        to that of most ladies” (<name>Bruce</name> 376). Furthermore, she was
                        surrounded by books, albeit those “principally [of] Divinity” and
                        “Geography, History, Voyages and Travels, with Maps” (<name>Mitford</name>
                        89). Her father regarded novels and other forms of literature, as well as
                        pursuits such as card-playing, to be the works of the Devil, and raised his
                        family within the confines of strict Puritanism (<name>Mitford</name> 89;
                        ODNB ). </p>
                    <p>In their remote location, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and her
                        family were isolated from society at large, making only occasional
                        excursions to the mainland, and otherwise occupying themselves with the
                        daily domestic duties of the lighthouse (<name>Bruce</name>). Perhaps as a
                        result of this confined but (for <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>,
                        apparently) enjoyable upbringing, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>
                        was “remarkable for a retiring and somewhat reserved disposition”
                            (<name>Bruce</name> 376). She assisted her father in his work on the
                        lighthouse and kept watch at times (ODNB), bearing witness to several wrecks
                        and rescues over the course of her lifetime but never participating in them,
                        as her older brothers were always present to help their father
                            (<name>Bruce</name>). </p>
                    <p>In this manner, for the first twenty-two years of her life, the mild-tempered
                        “young girl of five feet two, with small wrists” (<name>Sitwell</name> 61)
                        lived quietly in a household of sober industry and religious commitment. The
                        events of the early hours of <name>September 7, 1838</name>, however,
                        drastically expanded the confined world in which <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> lived, though they never seemed to
                        change her fundamental personality and temperament.</p>
                    <p>The Forfarshire, one of the largest steamships of its day, set off from port
                        on <date>September 6, 1838</date>, carrying around sixty people, crew and
                        passengers. Upon encountering a brutal storm near the <rs type="place"
                            key="archipelago">Farne Islands</rs>, the ship was wrecked on Big Harcar
                        Rock (<name>Mitford</name> 29). <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>,
                        keeping watch from the lighthouse, glimpsed the nine survivors at around
                        five o’clock on the morning of <date>September 7</date> and informed her
                        father (<name>Thomasin Darling</name>). Her older brothers had all left
                        their parents by then to live on the mainland, while her younger brother,
                        who was usually present at the lighthouse, was away on a fishing excursion
                            (<name>Mitford</name> 29). As a result, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING"
                            >Grace</name> was put in the unusual position of being the only
                        able-bodied assistant for her father. Most initial accounts of the story of
                        this day portray <name>William Darling</name> as reluctant and unwilling to
                        brave the stormy waters, while <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>
                        forced him into action by declaring her intention to go regardless of his
                        participation (<name>Sitwell</name>). Later accounts, however, have
                        questioned this depiction of the story, and the only firsthand written
                        account of the rescue is that of <name>William Darling</name> himself, in
                        the official letter he wrote to the Secretary of Trinity House. </p>
                    <p>His depiction of the rescue is a straightforward factual representation in
                        which he credits his “Daughter” with having “observed a vessel on Harker’s
                        Rock” and “incessantly [applying] the glass until near 7 o’clock when, the
                        tide being fallen [they] observed three or four men upon the rock.” He then
                        states that they “agreed that if [they] could get to them some of them would
                        be able to assist [them] back,” after which they “immediately launched
                        [their] boat, and [were] enabled to gain the rock.” <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and <name>William</name> then
                        returned to the Lighthouse with the sole woman and four of the men, two of
                        whom then returned with <name>William</name> to retrieve the remaining four
                        men (<name>William Darling</name>). The matter-of-fact attitude with which
                        these events were treated by the <name>Darling</name> family is evident in
                            <name>William Darling’s</name> account of the rescue. To a family of
                        lighthouse-keepers, dangerous rescues were fairly frequent occurrences, and
                        the efforts that <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and her father
                        put forth were expected and unremarkable. Indeed, William Darling is likely
                        to have thought of the prospect of "sole salvage rights" to the goods in the
                        wreck if he could reach the ship (ODNB). The rest of the nation, however,
                        did not perceive the event in such a pragmatic manner. Instead, the public
                        exalted the romantic and heroic nature of the event in a manner directly
                        opposed to the down-to-earth humility of the <name>Darlings’</name>
                        reaction.</p>
                    <p>The year <dateRange from="1838-01-01" to="1838-12-31">1838</dateRange>, one
                        year following the beginning of <name corresp="QUEEN_VICTORIA">Queen
                            Victoria’s</name> reign and its corresponding era, was a “moment [that]
                        was opportune for acclaiming female virtue” (Correspondent). Although <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and her father played equally
                        significant roles in the rescue of the survivors, it was <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and the combination of her
                        unconventional physical feat and virtuous humility, emblematic of ideal
                        Victorian womanhood, that attracted the media and publicity. The number of
                        visitors at the Longstone Lighthouse increased exponentially as people from
                        all over the country flocked to meet the great heroine and see the location
                        of her selfless deed.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the masses that besieged the once reclusive world of Longstone
                        Lighthouse, numerous institutions celebrated the <name>Darling</name>
                        family. The Royal Humane Society acknowledged <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING"
                            >Grace</name> and <name>William Darling</name> in a special general
                        court held on <date>October 31, 1838</date> that highlighted the
                        “intrepidity, presence of mind, and humanity that nobly urged
                            [<name>Grace</name>]” to rescue the survivors of the shipwreck
                            (<name>Thomasin Darling</name> 26). In addition to this acknowledgment,
                            <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and <name>William</name> each
                        received the society’s Golden Medallion, one of the highest honors of that
                        time. The Duke of <rs type="place" key="county">Northumberland</rs> was
                        chosen to deliver the honorific medallions, and he added to the delivery his
                        own gifts for the family: waterproof clothing, a silver teapot, a gold seal
                        engraved with <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name> initials, and
                        four pounds of tea. It was through this act of largesse that the lifelong
                        friendship between the Duke and <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>
                        began (<name>Thomasin Darling</name>).</p>
                    <p>Following the Royal Humane Society’s lead, many other national and local
                        institutions recognized <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name>
                        actions. She received medals from The Royal Institution for the Preservation
                        of Life from Shipwreck, The <rs type="place" key="city">Edinburgh</rs> and
                            <rs type="place" key="district">Leith</rs> Humane Society, The <rs
                            type="place" key="city">Glasgow</rs> Humane Society, and The Shipwreck
                        Society of <rs type="place" key="city">Newcastle</rs>. Some organizations,
                        such as Lloyds, the insurance company, and The Ladies of <rs type="place"
                            key="city">Edinburgh</rs>, chose to send money and stocks to <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and her father. Just a year after
                        the shipwreck, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> had received about
                        seven hundred and fifty pounds' worth of stock (<name>Thomasin
                            Darling</name>). </p>
                    <p>Medals, stocks, and money were not the only gifts that <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and her family received. Admirers
                        sent a plethora of treasures that included silver tea sets, jewelry, and
                        even a beaver bonnet. The number of presents received by the family, despite
                        its immensity, was insignificant in comparison to the number of letters sent
                        to the lighthouse. Many people wrote simply to praise <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>, demonstrating the public
                        fascination surrounding her. Others wrote to describe how they had lost
                        loved ones in shipwrecks and to thank <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING"
                            >Grace</name> for preventing others from suffering the same loss. <name
                            corresp="QUEEN_VICTORIA">Queen Victoria</name> herself recognized and
                        contributed to <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name> national
                        prominence when the <name>Darlings</name> received a letter from the <rs
                            type="place" key="kingdom">United Kingdom’s</rs> Treasury stating that
                        “Her Majesty [had] been called to the circumstances attending the Wreck of
                        the Forfarshire Steamer” and wished to acknowledge <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace Darling</name> for her actions in saving
                        the survivors (<name>Thomasin Darling</name> 30). Amongst all of these
                        letters, however, there is no evidence that <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING"
                            >Grace</name> ever received acknowledgement from the survivors of the
                        Forfarshire’s wreck (<name>Thomasin Darling</name>).</p>
                    <p><name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> attempted to reply to every letter
                        and gift she received. She usually declined any admiration or gratitude,
                        insisting that she was simply God’s instrument, and that therefore it was
                        God who deserved the thanks. Many people wrote to <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> asking for a signature or lock of
                        her hair, leading her to begin enclosing locks of hair in her responses as a
                        means of repayment for the recognition she received (<name>Thomasin
                            Darling</name>). This custom soon ended, however, as <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> “would soon have been left with a
                        closely cropped head” had her attempts to satisfy the demanding public
                        continued in this manner (<name>Thomasin Darling</name> 47).</p>
                    <p>Despite this sudden burst of popularity and fame, <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> “shrank from, not courted, the
                        public” (<name>Thomasin Darling</name> 38), behavior that simultaneously
                        reinforced the Victorian conception of her virtuous nature and characterized
                        her as a shy and wild creature threatened by the hungry public
                            (<name>Sitwell</name>). <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>
                        received many offers to be properly introduced to <rs type="place"
                            key="city">London’s</rs> society, some including paid appearances, but
                        she refused all of them. The Duke of <rs type="place" key="county"
                            >Northumberland</rs>, now a family friend and patron, understood <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name> reluctance to embrace her fame
                        and worked to spare her from undesired exhibition. When <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> received letters requesting her
                        appearance at various ceremonies and functions, she informed the Duke and he
                        wrote politely worded refusals on her behalf. Eventually, people began to
                        write to the Duke in order to pass messages on to <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>. Grateful for this understanding
                        and help, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> called the Duke her
                        Guardian and herself his servant (<name>Thomasin Darling</name>).</p>
                    <p>The Duke was not able to shield <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>
                        from the artistic community, however. The events of that September morning
                        seized the artistic imagination of the era, and painters such as <name>J.W.
                            Carmichael</name> and <name>Thomas Musgrave Joy</name> requested that
                            <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and her father sit for
                        portraits. Many times, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> would be
                        forced to reenact awkward positions in order for the painters to properly
                        portray the scene of the Forfarshire’s shipwreck. There were also many books
                        dedicated to <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name> story. Many of
                        them were written as romances, with loose treatment of the facts of the
                        event. <name>William Wordsworth</name> commemorated <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and her actions in verse considered
                        to be beautifully and poetically written, but also greatly romanticized and
                        “embarrassing” (ODNB). <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> did not
                        read or pay attention to any of the novels, in keeping with her strict
                        upbringing (<name>Thomasin Darling</name>).</p>
                    <p>She continued to “politely refuse” all offers of paid appearances
                        (Correspondent) and to decline invitations to enter into <rs type="place"
                            key="city">London</rs> society, as <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING"
                            >Grace</name> was content to focus on her chores and duties at Longstone
                        and to remain a companion and helper to her parents. She refused numerous
                        offers of marriage following her rise in fame (<name>Bruce</name>), and
                        “clung to her father and to her name, [explaining] that any husband of hers
                        should take it” (<name>Thomasin Darling</name> 11). She showed no
                        indications of yearning for something more than what she had, and refuted
                        the assumption that her quiet life on the island was unfulfilling, stating
                        that she “[had] no time to spare” as she had “seven apartments in the house
                        to keep in a state fit to be inspected every day by Gentlemen, so that [her]
                        hands [were] kept very busy” (<name>Mitford</name>, 89 and 90). Despite the
                        external clamor and demands of the public, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING"
                            >Grace</name> was satisfied with the quiet confinement, humble industry,
                        and familial duty of the lighthouse. </p>
                    <p>In this way, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> lived contentedly at
                        the Longstone Lighthouse until a sudden decline in her health occurred after
                        a visit to her oldest brother on <rs type="place" key="Island">Coquet

                            >1842</dateRange>. In the hope of improving her condition, <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name> parents sent her and her sister,

                            (<name>Thomasin Darling</name>, Britain Unlimited). While there, <name

                        greatly enjoyed spending time with her sister and was beginning to feel
                        better. <name>Thomasin’s</name> letters contradicted <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name> claim, however, as she wrote that
                        her sister’s coughs remained about the same (<name>Thomasin
                        Darling</name>).</p>
                    <p>The two sisters then went to <rs type="place" key="town">Alnwick</rs>, the
                        residence of the Duke of <rs type="place" key="county">Northumberland</rs>,
                        as the Duke had requested that <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> be
                        treated by his personal doctor. <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name>
                        health never improved, however, and the doctor said that her disease was one
                        which “no skill, nor care, nor kindness could arrest” (<name>Thomasin
                            Darling</name> 56). In one last attempt to save their daughter, the
                            <name>Darlings</name> sent <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> to
                            <name>Thomasin’s</name> home in <rs type="place" key="village"
                            >Bamborough</rs>. Much to everyone’s surprise, <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> began to show signs of increasing
                        health within the first few days in <rs type="place" key="village"
                            >Bamborough</rs>. Despite this short-lived hope, <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> died several days later on
                            <date>October 20th, 1842</date> at the age of twenty-seven, a victim of
                        what is believed to have been tuberculosis (<name>Thomasin Darling</name>,
                        Britain Unlimited). She was buried in St. Aidan’s Churchyard, less than one
                        hundred yards from where she had been born (Britain Unlimited). </p>
                    <p>Though <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> was dead, her fame lived on
                        in literature, art, popular culture, and, most significantly, the national
                        consciousness. As <name>Edith Sitwell</name> put it, “to the last day of her
                        life <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace Darling</name> could not see that
                        she had done anything extraordinary…but she became the pride of the nation”
                            (<name>Sitwell</name> 62). Certain types of heroic legend coincided in
                        her, as in the physical courage and prowess of <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC"
                            >Joan of Arc</name>, the wild, indigenous innocence and rescue of <name
                            corresp="POCAHONTAS">Pocahontas</name> or Walter Scott's heroines, and
                        other romantic themes apart from love and marriage. In turn, she became a
                        type recognized in other women's deeds around the world, even for
                        predecessors such as the "Grace Darling of Newfoundland," <name>Ann
                            Harvey</name>, who helped to rescue 180 survivors of a shipwreck in
                            <date>1828</date> (Ann Harvey). To the Victorian Era, <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> stood as an emblem of both <rs
                            type="place" key="kingdom">British</rs> courage and female virtue that
                        resonated deeply with that era's imperialism and idealism. She was a woman
                        with a truly “<rs type="place" key="country">English</rs> heart”
                            (<name>Mitford</name>) who represented the absolute best of her society,
                        and gave its members hope and faith in a time of transition. </p>
