                    <p>DOROTHY WYNDLOW PATTISON was born on January 15th, 1832. She was the youngest
                        daughter, and the youngest child but one, of the Rev. Mark Pattison, who was
                        for many years Rector of Hauxwell, near Richmond, in Yorkshire. She
                        inherited from her father, who was of a Devonshire family, that finely
                        proportioned and graceful figure which she always maintained; and from her
                        mother, who was the daughter of a banker in Richmond, those lovely features
                        which drew forth the admiration of everyone who had the pleasure of knowing
                        her.</p>

                    <p>Her father was a good and sincere man. He was thoroughly upright and
                        strict.</p>

                    <p>Dora and her sister, like a thousand other country parsons' daughters, were
                        of the utmost use in their father's Yorkshire parish. A French gentleman who
                        had lived a while in England and in the country, said to me one day:</p>

                    <p>"Your young ladies astound me. They are angels of mercy. They wear no
                        distinguishing habit; one does not see their wings, yet they fly everywhere,
                        and everywhere bring grace and love and peace - in my country such a thing
                        would be impossible."</p>

                    <p>These Pattison girls were for ever saving their pocket money to give it away,
                        ani they made it a rule to mend and remake their old frocks, so as not to
                        have to buy new ones out of their allowance for clothes, so as to have more
                        to give. Even their dinners they would reserve for poor people, and content
                        themselves with bread and cheese. " Giving to others instead of spending on
                        themselves seems to have been the rule and delight of their lives."</p>

                    <p>A pretty story is told of Dorothy at this time. A schoolboy in the village,
                        who was especially attached to her, fell ill of rheumatic fever. The boy's
                        one longing was to see "Miss Dora" again, but she was abroad on the
                        Continent. As he grew worse and worse, he constantly prayed that he might
                        live long enough to see her. On the day on which she was expected, he sat up
                        on his pillows intently listening, and at last, long before any-one else
                        could hear a sound of wheels, he exclaimed : "There she is!" and sank back.
                        She went to him at once, and nursed him till he died.</p>

                    <p>Her beauty was very great: large brilliant, brown eyes, full red lips, a firm
                        chin and a finely cut profile; her hair dark, and slightly curling, waved
                        all over her head; and the remarkable beauty and delicacy of her colouring
                        and complexion, added to the liveliness of her expression, made her a
                        fascinating creature to behold. Her father always called her "Little
                        Sunshine."</p>

                    <p>But the most remarkable feature about her was to be found in her inner being.
                        A will, which no earthly power could subdue, enabled her to accomplish an
                        almost superhuman work; yet at times it was to her a faculty that brought
                        her into difficulties. She was twenty 'line before she was able to find real
                        scope for her energies, and then she took a bold step answered an
                        advertisement from a clergyman for a lady to take the village school. Her
                        mother had died in 1861, and she considered herself free from duties that
                        bound her to her home. Her father did not relish the step she took, but
                        acquiesced. She went to Woolston, and remained there three years, during
                        which time she won the hearts, not of the children only, but of their
                        parents as well. She had to live alone in a cottage, and do everything for
                        her self; but the people never for a moment doubted she was a real lady, and
                        always treated her with great respect.</p>

                    <p>Not thinking a little village school sufficient field for her energies, she
                        resolved to join a nursing sisterhood at Redcar, in Yorkshire. The life was
                        not quite suited to her strong will, but it did her good. She there learned
                        how to make beds and to cook. At first she literally sat down and cried when
                        the beds which she had just put in order were all pulled to pieces by some
                        superior authority, who did not approve of the method in which they were
                        made. But it was a useful lesson for her after life in a hospital. She was
                        there till the early part of 1865, and then was sent to Walsall to help at a
                        small cottage hospital, which had already been established for more than a
                        year.</p>

                    <p>Walsall, though not in the "Black Country," is in a busy manufacturing
                        district, chiefly of iron. At the time when Sister Dora went there it
                        contained a population of 35,000 inhabitants. It is now connected with
                        Birmingham by almost continuous houses and pits and furnaces.</p>

                    <p>As fresh coal and iron pits were being opened in the district around Walsall,
                        accidents became more frequent, and it was found impracticable to send those
                        injured to Birmingham, which was seven miles distant; Accordingly, in 1863,
                        the Town Council invited the Redcar Society to start a hospital there. When
                        the Sister who had begun the work fell ill, Sister Dora was sent in her
                        place, and almost directly caught small-pox from the outpatients. She was
                        very ill, and even in her delirium showed the bent of her mind by ripping
                        her sheets into strips to serve as bandages.</p>

                    <p>When the cottage hospital—which was the second of its kind in England — was
                        opened, the system of voluntary nursing was unknown; the only voluntary
                        nurses heard of then being those who had gone out to the Crimea with Miss
                        Florence Nightingale. Therefore a good deal of misunderstanding was the
                        result; but in the course of time people began to judge the institution by
                        its results. But Sister Dora, by her frank, open manner, disarmed suspicion,
                        while the sublime eloquence of noble deeds silenced tongues, and won for the
                        hospital the confidence of the public, and for herself the admiration and
                        affection of the people.</p>

                    <p>In 1866 she had a serious illness, brought on by expo-sure to wet and cold.
                        She would come home from dressing wounds in the cottages, wet through and
                        hot with hurrying along the streets, to find a crowd of outpatients awaiting
                        her return at the hospital, and she would attend to them in total disregard
                        of herself, and allow her wet clothes ro dry on her.</p>

                    <p>This neglect occurred once too often; a chill settled on her, and for three
                        weeks she was dangerously ill. Then it was that the people of Walsall began
                        to realise what she was, and the door of the hospital was besieged by poor
                        people come to inquire how their "Sister Dora" was.</p>

                    <p>The hospital had moved men of every shade of politics, and every form of
                        religious belief, to the work, and there have been passages in its history
                        not pleasant to remember, but not one of these in the remotest degree
                        involved Sister Dora. On the contrary, her presence and counsel always
                        brought light and peace, and lifted every question into a higher sphere.
                        "Ask Sister Dora," it used to be said. "Had we not better send for Sister
                        Dora" some member would exclaim out of the fog of contention. Thereupon she
                        would appear; and many well remember how calmly self-possessed, and clear
                        sighted she would stand -- never sit down. Indeed, there were those who
                        worked with her fifteen years who never saw her seated; she would stand,
                        usually with her hand on the back of the chair which had been placed for
                        her, every eye directed to her; nor was it ever many moments before she had
                        grasped the whole question, and given her opinion just as clearly and simply
                        and straight to the purpose as any opinion given to the sufferers in the
                        wards. Nor was she ever wrong; nor did she ever fail of her purpose with the
                        committee. No committeemen ever questioned or differed from Sister Dora, yet
                        in her was the charm of unconsciousness of power or superiority and the
                        impression left was of there being no feeling of pleasure in her, other than
                        the triumph of the right.</p>

                    <p>In 1867 the cottage hospital had to be abandoned, as erysipelas broke out and
                        would not be expelled. The wards were evidently impregnated with malignant
                        germs to such an extent that the committee resolved to build a new hospital
                        in a better situation.</p>

                    <p>Sister Dora's work became more engrossing when this larger field was opened
                        for it; the men's beds were constantly full, and even the women's ward was
                        hardly ever entirely empty.</p>

                    <p>Just at this period an epidemic of small-pox broke out in Walsall, and all
                        the energies of Sister Dora were called into play. She visited the cottages
                        where the patients lay, and nursed them or saw to their being supplied with
                        what they needed; whilst at the same time carrying on her usual work at the
                        hospital.</p>

                    <p>One night she was sent for by a poor man who was dying of what she called
                        "black-pox," a violent form of small-pox.' She went at once, and found him
                        in the last extremity. All his relations had fled, and a neighbour alone was
                        with him. When Sister Dora found that only one small piece of candle was
                        left in the house, she gave the woman some money, begging her to go and buy
                        some means of light whilst she stayed with the man. She sat on by his bed,
                        but the woman, who had probably spent the money at the public house, never
                        returned; and after some little while the dying man raised him-self up in
                        bed with a last effort, saying, "Sister, kiss me before I die." She took
                        him, all covered as he was with the loathsome disease, into her arms and
                        kissed him, the candle going out almost as she did so, leaving them in total
                        darkness. He implored her not to leave him while he lived, although he might
                        have known she would never do that. So she sat through the night, till the
                        early dawn breaking in revealed that the man was dead.</p>

                    <p>When the bell at the head of her bed rang at night she rose at once, saying
                        to herself, " The Master is come, and calleth for thee!" Indeed, she loved
                        to think that she was ministering to her Lord in the person of His poor and
                        sick.</p>

                    <p>Here is a letter from a former patient in the hospital, from which only a
                        short extract can be made:</p>

                    <p>"I had not been there above a week when Sister Dora found me a little bell,
                        as there was not one to my bed, and she said, 'Enoch, you must ring this
                        bell when you want sister.' This little bell did not have much rest, for
                        whenever I heard her step or the tinkle of her keys in the hall I used to
                        ring my bell, and she would call out, 'I 'm coming, Enoch,' which she did,
                        and would say, 'What do you want?' I often used to say, 'I don't know,
                        Sister," not really knowing what I did want. She 'd say, 'Do you want your
                        pillows shaken up, or do you want moving a little?' which she 'd do,
                        whatever it was, and say, 'Do you feel quite cosey now?' ' Yes, Sister.'
                        Then she would start to go into the other ward, but very often before she
                        could get through the door I 'd call her back and say my pillow wasn't quite
                        right, or that my leg wanted moving a little. She would come and do it,
                        whatever it was, and say, 'Will that do ?' 'Yes, Sister.' Then she 'd go
                        about her work, but at the very next sound of her step my bell would ring,
                        and so often as my bell rang Sister would come; and some of the other
                        patients would often remark that I should wear that little bell out or
                        Sister, and she'd say, 'Never mind, for I like to hear it, and it 's never
                        too often.' And it rang so often that I 've heard Sister say that she often
                        dreamt she heard my little bell and started up in a hurry t0 find it was a
                        dream."</p>

                    <p>Sister Dora said once to a friend, who was engaging a servant for the
                        hospital:</p>

                    <p>"Tell her this is not an ordinary house, or even a hospital. I want her to
                        understand that all who serve here, in whatever capacity, ought to have one
                        rule, love for God, and then, I need not say, love for their work."</p>

                    <p>She spoke often and with intense earnestness, on the duty. the necessity, of
                        prayer. It was literally true that she never touched a wound without raising
                        her heart to God and entreating him to bless the means employed As years
                        glided away, she became able almost to fulfil the Apostle's command: "Pray
                        without ceasing." And her prayers were animated by the most intense faith —
                        an absolutely unshaken conviction of their efficacy. It may truly be said
                        that those who pray become increasingly more sure of the value of prayer.
                        They find that, whatever men may say about the reign of law and the order of
                        nature, earnest prayer does bring an answer, often in a marvellous manner.
                        The praying man or woman is never shaken in his or her trust in the efficacy
                        of prayer. She firmly held to the supernatural power, put into the hands of
                        men by means of the weapon of prayer; and the practical faithlessness in
                        this respect of the world at large was an ever-increasing source of surprise
                        and distress to her.</p>

                    <p>Since her death, in commemoration of her labours at Walsall, a very beautiful
                        statue has been there erected to her, and on the pedestal are bas-reliefs
                        representing incidents in her life there. One of these illustrates a
                        terrible explosion that took place in the Birchett's Iron Works, on Friday,
                        October 15, 1875, whereby eleven men were so severely burnt that only two
                        survived. All the others died after their admission into the hospital. It
                        came about thus: The men were at work when water escaped from the "twyer"
                        and fell upon the molten iron in the furnace and was at once resolved into
                        steam that blew out the front of the furnace, and also the molten iron,
                        which fell upon the men. Some suffered frightful agonies, but the shock to
                        the nervous systems of others had stupefied them. The sight and the smell
                        were terrible. Ladies who volunteered their help could not endure it, and
                        were forced to withdraw, some not getting beyond the door of the ward. But
                        Sister Dora was with the patients incessantly till they died, giving them
                        water, bandaging their wounds, or cutting away the sodden clothes that
                        adhered to the burnt flesh. Some lingered on for ten days, but in all this
                        time she never deserted the fetid atmosphere of the ward, never went to
                        bed.</p>

                    <p>She had so much to do with burns that she became specially skilful in
                        treating them. Children terribly burnt or scalded were constantly brought to
                        the hospital; often men came scalded from a boiler, or by molten metal. She
                        dressed their wounds herself, but, if possible, always sent the patients to
                        be tended at home, where she would visit them and regularly dress their
                        wounds, rather than have the wards tainted by the effluvium from the burns.
                        Her treatment of burnt children merits quotation.</p>

                    <p>"If a large surface of the body was burnt, or if the child seemed beside
                        itself with terror, she did not touch the wounds themselves, but only
                        carefully excluded the air from them by means of cotton wool and blankets
                        wrapped around the body. She put hot bottles and flannel to the feet, and,
                        if necessary, ice to the head. Then she gave her attention to soothing and
                        consoling the shocked nerves — a state which she considered to be often a
                        more immediate source of danger to the life of the child than the actual
                        injuries. She fed it with milk and brandy, unless it violently refused food,
                        when she would let it alone until it came round, saying that force, or
                        anything which involved even a slight further shock to the system, was worse
                        than useless. Sometimes, of course, the fatal sleep of exhaustion, from
                        which there was no awakening, would follow; but more often than not food was
                        successfully administered, and after a few hours, Sister Dora, having gained
                        the child's confidence, could dress the wounds without fear of exciting the
                        frantic terror which would have been the result of touching them at
                        first."</p>

                    <p>Children Sister Dora dearly loved; her heart went out to them with infinite
                        tenderness, and she was even known to sleep with a burnt baby on each arm.
                        What that means only these know who have had experience of the sickening
                        smell arising from burns.</p>

                    <p>Once a little girl of nine was brought into the hospital so badly burnt that
                        it was obvious she had not many hours to live. Sister Dora sat by her bed
                        talking to her of Jesus Christ and His love for little children, and of the
                        blessed home into which he would receive them. The child died peacefully,
                        and her last words were : "Sister, when you come to heaven, I'll meet you at
                        the gates with a bunch of flowers."</p>

                    <p>One of the most heroic of her many heroic acts was taking charge of the
                        small-pox hospital when a second* epidemic broke out.</p>

                    <p>Mr. S. Welsh says: " In the spring of 1875 there was a second visitation of
                        the disease, and fears were entertained that the results would be as bad as
                        during the former visitation. One morning Sister Dora came to me and said,
                        'Do you know, I have an idea that if some one could be got to go to the
                        epidemic hospital in whom the people have confidence, they would send their
                        friends to be nursed, the patients would be isolated, and the disease
                        stamped out.' " This was because a prejudice was entertained against the new
                        small-pox hospital, and those who had sick concealed the fact rather than
                        send them to it. "I said," continues Mr. Welsh, "'I have long been of the
                        opinion you have just expressed; but where are we to get a lady, in whom the
                        people would have confidence, to undertake the duty?'</p>

                    <p>"Her prompt reply was, 'I will go.'</p>

                    <p>"I confess the sudden announcement of her deter mination rather took me by
                        surprise, for I had no expectation of it, and not the least remote idea that
                        she intended to go. 'But,' I said, 'who will take charge of the hospital if
                        you go there?'</p>

                    <p>" 'Oh,' she replied, ' I can get plenty of ladies to come there, but none
                        will go to the epidemic. And,' she added, by way of reconciling me to her
                        view, 'it will only be for a short time.'</p>

                    <p>"'But what if you were to take the disease and die?' I inquired.</p>

                    <p>"'Then,' she added, in her cheery way, 'I shall have died in the path of
                        duty, and, you know, I could not die better.'</p>

                    <p>"I knew it was no use pointing out at length the risk she ran, for where it
                        was a case of saving others, self with her was no consideration. I tried to
                        dissuade her on other grounds. . . A few days later I was in company with
                        the doctor of the hospital, who was also medical officer of health, and who,
                        as such, had charge of the epidemic hospital, near to which we were at the
                        time. He said, 'Do you know where Sister Dora is?' 'At the hospital I
                        suppose,' was my reply. 'No,' he rejoined, 'she is over there!' pointing to
                        the epidemic hospital.</p>

                    <p>"The people as soon as they knew Sister Dora was in charge, had no misgiving
                        about sending their relatives to be nursed, and the result was as she had
                        predicted; to be cases were brought in as soon as it was discovered that
                        patients had the disease, and the epidemic was speedily stamped out."</p>

                    <p>She had, however, a hard time of it there, as she lacked assistants. Two
                        women were sent from the work-house, but they proved of little use. The
                        porter, an old soldier, was attentive and kind in his way, but he always
                        went out "on a spree'' on Saturday nights, and did not return till late on
                        Sunday evening. When the workhouse women failed her she was sometimes alone
                        with her patients, and these occasionally in the delirium of small-pox.</p>

                    <p>It was not till the middle of August, 1875, that the last small-pox patient
                        departed from the hospital, and she was able to return to her original
                        work.</p>

                    <p>One of the bas-reliefs on her monument represents Sister Dora consoling the
                        afflicted and the scene depicted refers to a dreadful colliery accident that
                        occurred on March 14, 1872, at Pelsall, a village rather over three miles
                        from Walsall, by which twenty-two men were entombed, and all perished. For
                        several days hopes were entertained that some of the men would be got out
                        alive; and blankets in which to wrap them, and restoratives, were provided,
                        and Sister Dora was sent for to attend the men when brought to "bank." The
                        following extract, from an article by a special correspondent in a
                        newspaper, dated Dec 10, 1872, will give some idea of Sister Dora's
                        connection with the event:</p>

                    <p>Out of doors the scene is weird and awful, and impresses the mind with a
                        peculiar gloom; for the intensity of the darkness is heightened by the
                        shades created by the artificial lights. Every object, the most minute,
                        stands out in bold relief against the inky darkness which surrounds the
                        landscape. On the crest of the mound or pit-bank, the policemen, like
                        sentinels, are walking their rounds. The wind is howling and whistling
                        through the trees which form a background to the pit-bank, and the rain is
                        coming hissing down in sheets. In a hovel close to the pit shaft sit the
                        bereaved and disconsolate mourners, hoping against hope, and watching for
                        those who will never return. There, too, are the swarthy sons of toil who
                        have just returned from their fruit-less search in the mine for the dear
                        missing ones, and are resting while their saturated clothes are drying.</p>

                    <p>But another form glides softly from that hovel; and amid the pelting rain,
                        and over the rough pit-bank, and through miry clay—now ankle deep—takes her
                        course to the dwellings of the mourners, for some, spent with watching, have
                        been induced to return to their homes. As she plods her way amid pieces of
                        timber, upturned wagons and fragments of broken machinery, which are
                        scattered about in great confusion, a "wee, wee bairn" creeps gently to her
                        side, and grasping her hand and looking wistfully into her face, which is
                        radiant with kindness and affection, says, "Oh, Sister, do see to my father
                        when they bring him up the pit." Poor child! Never again would he know a
                        father's love, or share a father's care. She smiled, and that smile seemed
                        to lighten the child's load of grief, and her promise to see to his father
                        appeared to impart consolation to his heavy, despairing heart.</p>

                    <p>On she glides, with a kind word or a sympathetic expression to all. One
                        woman, after listening to her comforting words, burst into tears—the
                        fountains of sorrow so Iong pent up seemed to have found vent. "Let her
                        weep," said a relative of the unfortunate woman; "it is the first tear she
                        has shed since the accident has occurred, and it will do her good to cry."
                        But who is the good Samaritan? She is the sister who for seven years has had
                        the management of the nursing department in the cottage hospital at
                        Walsall.</p>

                    <p>This is written in too much of the "special correspondent" style to be
                        pleasant; nevertheless it describes what actually took place.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Samuel Welsh says : "I remember one evening I was in the hospital when a
                        poor man who had been dreadfully crushed in a pit was brought in. One of his
                        legs was so fearfully injured that it was thought it would be necessary to
                        amputate it. After examining the patient, the doctor came to me in the
                        committee-roomone door of which opened into the passage leading to the wards
                        and another into the hall in the domestic portion of the building. After
                        telling me about the patient who had just been brought in, he said, 'Do you
                        know Sister Dora is ver ill? So ill,' he continued, 'that I question if she
                        will pull through this time.' I naturally inquired what she was suffering
                        from, and in reply the doctor said, 'She will not take care of herself, and
                        is suffering from blood-poison.' He left me, and I was just trying to solve
                        the problem — 'What shall be done? or how shall her place be supplied if she
                        be taken from us by death?' when I saw a spectral-like figure gliding gently
                        and almost noiselessly through the room from the domestic entrance to the
                        door leading to the wards. The figure was rather indistinct, for it was
                        nearly dark, and as I gazed at tie receding form, I said, 'Sister, is it
                        you?' 'Whist!' s e said, and glided through the door-way into the ward . In
                        a short time she returned, and I said to her, 'Sister, the doctor has just
                        been telling me how ill you are — how is it you are here?' 'All!' replied,
                        she ' it is t e I am very ill; but I heard the surgeons talking about
                        amputating that poor fellow's limb, and I wanted to s e whether or not there
                        was a possibility of saving it, and I believe there is; and, knowing that, I
                        shall rest better.' So saying, she glided as noiselessly out of the room as
                        when she entered.</p>

                    <p>"On her recover -which was retarded by her neglecting herself to attend to
                        others — she called me one day to the hall-door of th hospital, and asked me
                        if I thought it was going to rat . I told her I did not think it would rain
                        for some hours. She then told me to go and order a cab to be ready at the
                        hospital in half an hour. I tried to persuade her not to venture out so
                        soon; but it was no use — she went; and many a time I wondered where she
                        went to.</p>

                    <p>"About six months afterward I happened to be at a railway station, and saw a
                        pointsman who had been in our hospital with an injured foot, but who, as his
                        friends wished to have him at home, had left before his foot was cured. I
                        inquired how his foot was. He replied that had it not been for Sister Dora
                        he would have lost his foot, if not his life. I said, 'How did she save your
                        foot when you were not in the hospital, and she was ill at the time you left
                        the hospital?' 'Well,' he replied, 'you know my foot was far from well when
                        I left the hospital; there was no one at our house who could see to it
                        properly, and it took bad ways, and one evening I was in awful pain. Oh, how
                        I did wish for Sister Dora to come and dress it! I felt sure she could give
                        me relief, but I had been told she was very ill, so I had no hope that my
                        earnest desire would be realised; but while I was thinking and wishing, the
                        bedroom door was gently opened, and a figure just like Sister Dora glided so
                        softly into the room that I could not hear her, but oh! she was so pale that
                        I began to think it must be her spirit but when she folded the bedclothes
                        from off my foot, I knew it was she. She dressed my foot, and from that hour
                        it began to improve.'</p>

                    <p>"A few days after this interview with the pointsman I was talking to Sister
                        Dora, and said: 'By the bye, Sister, I have found out where you went with
                        the cab that day.' She replied with a merry twinkle in her eye, 'What a long
                        time you have been finding it out!"</p>

                    <p>Her old patients ever remembered her with gratitude. A man called Chell, an
                        engine-stoker, was twice in the hospital under her care, first with a
                        dislocated ankle, severely cut; the second time with a leg crushed to pieces
                        in a railway accident. It was amputated. Ac-cording to his own account he
                        remembered nothing of the operation, except that Sister Dora was there, and
                        that, "When I come to after the chloroform, she was on her knees by my side
                        with her arm supporting my head, and she was repeating:</p>

                    <lg>
                        <l>" They climbed the steep ascent of heaven,</l>
                        <l>Through peril, toil and pain:</l>
                        <l>O God, to us may grace be given</l>
                        <l>To follow in their train.'</l>
                    </lg>

                    <p>And all through the pain and trouble that I had afterward, I never forgot
                        Sister's voice saying those words," When she was in the small-pox hospital,
                        avoided by most, this man never failed to stump away to it to see her and
                        inquire how she was getting on.</p>

                    <p>There were, as she herself recognised, faults in the character of Sister
                        Dora; and yet, without these faults, problematical as it may seem, it is
                        doubtful whether she could have achieved all she did.</p>

                    <p>One who knew her long and intimately writes to me "A majestic character,
                        brimming over with sympathy, but, for lack of self-discipline, this sympathy
                        was impulsive and gushing. Her glorious nature, physical and mental, was
                        marred by undisciplined impulse. Her nature found its congenial outlet in
                        devoted works of mercy and love to her fellow creatures. How far she would
                        have done the same under authority, I fear is a little doubtful."</p>

                    <p>Miss Twigg, who knew her well, writes me: "She was a lovable woman, so bright
                        and winsome. She used to come into our rather dull and sad home (our mother
                        died when we were quite children) after evening service, She would nurse one
                        of us, big as we were then, and the others would gather round her, while she
                        would tell us stories of her hospital life. . She was a real woman."</p>

                    <p>There is one point in Sister Dora's life to which sufficient attention has
                        not been paid by her biographers. It is one which the busy workers of the
                        present day think of too little—namely, the writing of bright, helpful
                        letters to any friend who is sick or in trouble. Somehow or other she always
                        found time for that, wrote one who knew her well, and who contributes the
                        following, written to a young girl who was at the time in a spinal hospital,
                        and who was almost a stranger to her:</p>

                    <p>MY Dear Miss J.—I was so glad to hear from you, though I fear it must be a
                        trouble for you to write. I do hope that you will really have benefited by
                        the treatment and rest. I am so glad that the doctor is good to his
                        "children." Such little attentions when you are sick help to alleviate
                        wonderfully. I wish-I could come and take a peep at you. Did Mrs. N. tell
                        you that she had sent us five pounds for our seaside expedition? Was it not
                        good of her? Oh! we shall have such a jolly time. To see all those poor
                        creatures drink in the sea-breezes! We have had s very busy week of
                        accidents and operations. It has been a rev. lar storm.* My dear, it is in
                        such times as you are now having that the voice of Jesus Christ can be best
                        heard, "Come into a desert place awhile." Know you surely that it is God's
                        visitation. Take home that thought, realise it: God visiting you, Elizabeth
                        was astonished that the Mother of her Lord should visit her. We can have our
                        Emmanuel, I can look back or my sicknesses as the best times of my life.
                        Don't fret about the future. He carrieth our sicknesses and healeth our
                        infirmities. You know infirmity means weakness after sickness. Think of the
                        cheering lines of our hymn: "His touch has still its ancient power." When I
                        arose up from my sick bed they told me I should never be able to enter a
                        hospital or do work again. I was fretting over this when a good friend came
                        to me, and told me only to take a day's burden and not look forward, and it
                        was such a help. I got up every day feeling sure I should have strength and
                        grace for the day's trial. May it be said of you, dear, "They took knowledge
                        of her that she had been with Jesus." May He reveal Himself in all His
                        beauty is the prayer of</p>

                    <p>Your sincere friend,</p>

                    <p>SISTER DORA.</p>

                    <p>It does not truly represent Sister Dora to dwell on her outer life, and not
                        look as well into that which is within, as it was the very mainspring of all
                        her actions, as it, in fact, made her what she was.</p>

                    <p>The same writer to the Guardian gives some sentences from other letters:
                        "Take your cross day by day, dearie, and with Jesus Christ bearing the other
                        end it will not be too heavy." "If we could find Jesus, it must be on a
                        mountain, not in the plains or smooth places," "He went up into a mountain
                        and taught them, saying," etc. "It is only on a mountain side that we shall
                        see the cross. It was only after Zacchaeus had climbed the tree he could see
                        Jesus. I have been thinking much of this lately. It is not in the smooth
                        places we shall see Jesus, it is in the rough, in the storm, or by the sick
                        couch." "A Christian is one whose object is Christ." "I am rejoiced that you
                        are enjoying Faber's hymns; they always warm me up. Oh, my dear, is it not
                        sad that we prefer . to live in the shade when we might have the glorious
                        sunshine?"</p>

                    <p>It was during the winter of 1876-77 that Sister Dora felt the first approach
                        of the terrible disease that was to cause her death, and then it was rather
                        by diminution of strength than by actual pain. She consulted a doctor in
                        Birmingham, in whom she placed confidence, and he told her the plain truth,
                        that her days in this world were numbered. She exacted from him a pledge of
                        secrecy, and then went on with her work as hitherto.</p>

                    <p>"She was suddenly brought, as it were, face to face with death-- distant,
                        perhaps, but inevitable; she, who was full of such exuberant life and spirit
                        that the very word 'death' seemed a contradiction when applied to her. Even
                        her doctor, as he looked at her blooming appearance, and measured with his
                        eye her finely made form, was almost inclined to believe the evidence of his
                        outward senses against his sober judgment. .</p>

                    <p>She could not endure pity. She, to whom everybody had learnt instinctively to
                        turn for help and consolation, on whom others leant for support, must she
                        now come down to ask of them sympathy and comfort? The pride of life was
                        still surging up in her, that pride which had made her glory in her physical
                        strength for its own sake, as well as for its manifold uses in the service
                        of her Master. True, she had been long living two lives in-separably
                        blended: the outward life of hard, unceasing toil; the inner, a constant
                        communion with the unseen world, the existence of which she realised to an
                        extent which not even those who saw the most of her could appreciate. To all
                        the poor, ignorant beings whose souls she tried to reach by means of their
                        maimed bodies, she was, indeed, the personification of all that they could
                        conceive as lovable, holy and merciful in the Saviour. At the same time she
                        judged her own self with strict impartiality. She knew her own faults, her
                        unbending will — her pride and glory in her work seemed to her even a fault;
                        and, in place of looking on herself as perfect she was bowed down with a
                        sense of her own short-comings. At the same time — with death before her,
                        she hungered for more work for her Master. His words were continually on her
                        lips: 'I must work the works of Him that sent me while it is day; the night
                        cometh when no man can work.'"</p>

                    <p>At last, in the month of August, 1878, typhoid fever having broken out in the
                        temporary hospital, it was found necessary to close it, and hasten on the
                        work of the construction of another. This gave her an opportunity for a
                        holiday and a complete change. She went to the Isle of Man, to London, and
                        to Paris.</p>

                    <p>But the disorder was making rapid strides, and was causing her intense
                        suffering, and she craved to be back at Walsall. She got as far as
                        Birmingham, and was then in such a critical state that it was feared she
                        would die. But her earnest entreaty was to be taken to Walsall. "Let me
                        die," she pleaded, "among my own people."</p>

                    <p>Mr. Welsh says: "On calling at the Queen's Hotel, Birmingham (where she was
                        lying ill), I was told the doctor of the hospital (Dr. Maclachlan) was with
                        her, and thinking they were probably arranging matters connected with the
                        hospital, I did not go to her room, but proceeded to the train. I had
                        scarcely got seated when the doctor called me out, and we entered a
                        compartment where we were alone. He asked me when it was intended to open
                        the hospital. I replied, 'On the 4th of November.' 'Then,' he said, 'that
                        will just be about the same time Sister Dora will die.'</p>

                    <p>"The announcement was to me a shock of no ordinary kind, for I had not heard
                        of her being ill, and no one could have imagined, from the cheerful tone of
                        a letter I had received from her a week or so before, that there was
                        anything the matter with her. Not being able to fully realise the true state
                        of affairs, I asked him if he were jesting. He replied he was not, and that
                        he thought it best to let me know at once, so that arrangements might be
                        made for getting someone to take her place when the hospital was opened. I
                        said, 'I suppose she is going to Yorkshire?' 'No,' he replied, 'and that is
                        another thing I wish to speak to you about. She wishes to die in Walsall,
                        and she must be removed immediately.</p>

                    <p>"On Sunday (the day following) I saw the chairman and vice-chairman of the
                        hospital. On Sunday evening I returned with Dr. Maclachlan to the Queen's
                        Hotel, where he found his patient very weak. On Mon-day morning a house was
                        taken, and the furniture she had in her rooms at the hospital removed to it.
                        Her old servant who had gone to The Potteries, was telegraphed for, and
                        arrived in a few hours, and by midday the house was ready for her reception.
                        My daughter, knowing Sister Dora's fondness for flowers, had procured and
                        placed on the table in the parlour a very choice bouquet; and when all was
                        ready Dr. Maclachlan drove over to Birmingham, and brought her to Walsall in
                        his private carriage.</p>

                    <p>"The disease was now making steady progress, and it was evident that every
                        day she was becoming weaker; but she never lost her cheerfulness, and anyone
                        to have seen her might have thought she was only suffering from some slight
                        ailment, instead of an incurable and painful disease."</p>

                    <p>"A few hours before her death," writes Mr. S. Welsh "she called me to her
                        bedside and said, 'I want you to promise that you will not, when I am gone,
                        write anything about me; quietly I came among you and, quietly I wish to go
                        away.'" And this desire of hers would have been faithfully complied with had
                        not misrepresentations fired the gentleman to whom the request was made to
                        take up his pen, not in defence of her, but in the correction of statements
                        that affected certain persons who were alive.</p>

                    <p>In her last sickness when she found her end approaching, she insisted on
                        every one leaving the room — it was her wish to die alone. And as she
                        persisted, so was it, only one nurse standing by the door held ajar, and
                        watching till she knew by the change of attitude, and a certain fixed look
                        in the countenance, that Sister Dora had entered into her test.</p>

                    <p>"It was Christmas Eve when she passed away, and a dense fog, like a funeral
                        pall, hung over the town and obscured every object a few feet from the
                        ground. Under this strange canopy the market was being held, and people were
                        busy buying and selling, and making preparations for the great Christmas
                        festival on the following day; but when the deep boom of the passing bell
                        announced the melancholy intelligence that Sister Dora had entered into her
                        rest, a thrill of horror ran through the people, who, with blanched cheeks
                        and bated breath, whispered, 'Can it be true?' Although for seven weeks the
                        process of dissolution had been going on before their eyes, they could not
                        realise the fact that she whom they loved and revered was no more."</p>

                    <p>The funeral took place on Saturday, the 28th of December. "The day was dark
                        and dismal, the streets, covered with slush and sludge caused by the melted
                        snow, were thronged with spectators. There was general mourning in the town,
                        and although it was market day nearly every shop was closed during the time
                        of the funeral, and all the blinds along the route of the procession were
                        drawn. . . . On reaching the cemetery it was found that four other funerals
                        had arrived from the workhouse; and as these coffins had been taken into the
                        chapel there was no room for Sister Dora's, which had, consequently, to be
                        placed in the porch. This was as Sister Dora would have wished, had she had
                        the ordering of the arrangements, for she always gave preference to the
                        poor, to whom she was attached in life, and from whom she would not have
                        desired to be separated in death."</p>

                    <p>True to her thought of others, in the midst of her last sufferings, she had
                        made arrangements for a Christmas dinner to be given to a number of her old
                        patients, in accordance with a custom of hers in previous years; but on this
                        occasion the festive proceedings were shorn of their gladness. All thought
                        of her who in her pain and on her deathbed had thought of them. Every one
                        tried, but ineffectually, to cheer and comfort the other, but the task was
                        hopeless. One young lady, after the meal, and while the Christmas tree was
                        being lighted commenced singing the pretty little piece, "Far Away," but
                        when she came to the words:</p>

                    <lg>
                        <l>Some are gone from us forever</l>
                        <l>Longer here they could not stay,</l>
                    </lg>

                    <p>she burst into tears; and the women present sobbed, and tears were seen
                        stealing down the cheeks of bearded men.</p>

                    <p>The Walsall writer of "A Review" concludes his paper thus:</p>

                    <p>She is no idol to us, but we worship her memory as the most saintly thing
                        that was ever given us. Her name is immortalised, both by her own surpassing
                        goodness, and by the love of a whole people for her—a love that will survive
                        through generations, and give a magic and a music to those simple words,
                        "Sister Dora," long after we shall have passed away. There was little we
                        could ever do—there was nothing she would let us do—to relieve the
                        self-imposed rigours of her life; but we love her in all sincerity, and now
                        !in our helplessness we find a serene joy in the knowledge that to her, as
                        surely as to any human soul, will be spoken the divine words: "Inasmuch as
                        ye have done it unto the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto
                        Me."</p>

                    <p>In Sister Dora, surely we have the highest type of the Christian life, the
                        inner and hidden life of the soul, the life that is hid in God, combined
                        with that outer life devoted to the doing of good to suffering and needy
                        humanity. In, the cloistered nun we see only the first, and that tends to
                        become self-centred and morbid ; it is redeemed from this vice by an active
                        life of self-sacrifice.</p>

                    <p>I cannot do better than, in conclusion, quote from the last letter ever
                        penned by Sister Dora:</p>

                    <p>"It is 2.30 A. M., and I cannot sleep, so I am going to write to you. I was
                        anything but 'forbearing,' dear; I was overbearing, and I am truly sorry for
                        it now. I look back on my life and see `nothing but leaves.' Oh, my darling,
                        let me speak to you from my deathbed, and say, watch in all you do that you
                        have a single aim — God's honour and glory. 'I came not to work my own work,
                        but the works of Him that sent me.' Look upon working as a privilege.. Do
                        not look upon nursing in the way they do so much nowadays, as an art or
                        science, but as work done for Christ. As you touch each patient, think it is
                        Christ Himself, and then virtue will come out of the touch to yourself. I
                        have felt that myself, when I have had a particularly loathsome patient. Be
                        full of the Glad Tidings, and you will tell others. You cannot give what you
                        have not got" </p>

                        <title>Biographies of Joan of Arc: A Looking Glass Into the Victorian Age</title>
                    </head>
                    <p>Preceding her canonization in <dateRange from="1920-01-01" to="1920-12-31">1920</dateRange>, the Victorian era experienced a revived interest in the historical figure <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc</name>. Because the biographical accounts written at the time reflect the various ideologies of the age, one doesn’t know what to expect of her portrayal. Was she illustrated as being a divinely inspired prophetess or simply an imaginative heroine? Universally, they regale her with flowery prose, depicting her as an archetypal tragic heroine who is wronged by her contemporaries; however it seems that Victorian authors are unable to agree on the extent of her holiness. Her secular self takes a back seat with her “divinity” pushed beneath the spotlight in some instances, and in others the case is reversed. Also, some authors comment on her adoption of male conduct, of wearing men’s attire and leading the men of the French military. Many authors state outright what they feel to be appropriate behavior of a member of the “fairer sex” while others neglect the issue entirely. These discordant viewpoints concerning <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc’s</name> divinity and adherence to gender role are reflective of the controversial social issues prominent during the Victorian era.</p>
                    <p><name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc</name> was born in the <rs type="place" key="Country">French</rs> village <rs type="place" key="Village">Domrémy</rs> to <name>Jacques d’Arc</name> and <name>Isabelle Romée</name> in <dateRange from="1412-01-01" to="1412-12-31">1412</dateRange>. Although sources generally portray her childhood as a happy one, the context of <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan’s</name> upbringing was both chaotic and violent. The French and the English were entangled in the Hundred Years’ War, an international conflict that would ultimately determine the future king of <rs type="place" key="Country">France</rs>. After 341 years of rule, the royal family line of the Capetians ended in <dateRange from="1328-01-01" to="1328-12-31">1328</dateRange> leaving the French throne unoccupied. Seeing that there was controversy concerning the establishment of a legitimate heir, in a desperate attempt to assume the throne both the French and the English participated in a war that would last for over a century. <name>Charles VI</name>, during one of his bouts of insanity, had signed the Treaty of <rs type="place" key="City">Troyes</rs> which ensured English ascension to the French throne. <name>Charles VII</name>, the Dauphin, became an illegitimate heir while the infant <name>Henry VI</name> the King of <rs type="place" key="Country">France</rs> in <dateRange from="1422-01-01" to="1421-12-31">1422</dateRange>. Those still loyal to <name>Charles VII</name> however would continue hostile resistance against English occupation.</p>
<p><name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc</name> claimed to have experienced visions since she was twelve, one of which included images of <name>Saint Michael</name>, <name>Saint Catherine</name> and <name>Saint Margaret</name> instructing her to rid <rs type="place" key="Country">France</rs> of the English and restore the Dauphin to the throne. The means in which Victorian authors attempt to explain this phenomenon is far from unanimous. For example, while biographer <name>Lord Ronald Gower</name> continuously refers to <name>Joan’s</name> “presences” as visions, <name>John Maskelyne</name> refers to them as mere “hallucinations” and “illusions,” (<name>Maskelyne</name>, 235). Biographer <name>William Adams</name> is caught up in the same dilemma, portraying the young <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan</name> as an impressionable child who was simultaneously directed by God (Adams, 245-247).</p>
<p>In response to her visions, at sixteen years of age <name>Joan</name> requested that she brought to Count Robert de Baudricourt so that she might earn permission to visit Charles VII at the royal court of Chinon (she would have to be escorted across enemy territory for the encounter with the Dauphin to take place). It would be her second attempt that would win the Count’s approval as she managed to accurately predict the result of the Battle of Herrings.</p>
<p>News of Joan’s visit spread quickly, therefore to test her divinity Charles dressed himself in commoner’s clothing and adorned another in rich garb to mislead her. When she arrived at court however, she knelt before Charles instead of the decoy, and despite Charles’ denials, declared him the true Dauphin: “‘In God’s name it is not they, but you, who are the King. Most noble Dauphin, I am Jeanne the Maid. The Heavenly King sends me to help you and the realm; and to tell you that you shall be anointed and crowned in the city of Rheims, and that you shall reign as lieutenant of the Heavenly King, who is the King of France,’” (Adams, 250). Pulling him aside for a private discussion—although there is no record of what was actually exchanged—she managed to convince him to allow her to lead his army against the English.</p>
<p>After having been granted permission to assist in the command of the French army, Joan deviated from traditional French tactics of war and managed a series of victories against the English, acquiring the fortress of Saint Loup on May 4, 1429, the fortress of Saint Jean le Blanc on May 5, the fortress of Saint Augustins May 6, and on May 7 the Orleans stronghold les Tourelles (an achievement that left her with a wounded neck). She would soon have another successive string of victories in the month to following, reclaiming Jargeau on June 12, Meung-sur-Loire on June 15, and Beaugency on June 17. Success was also to be had during the June 18 Battle of Patay which would be the turning point of the Hundred Years’ War, granting France the lead against England. As a result of her success in battle, one of the primary aims of Joan of Arc’s mission was accomplished with the coronation of Charles VII in Rheims on July 17.</p>
<p>Throughout sieges, captures, and even King Charles’ coronation, Joan wore the attire of a male knight. Although the French had tolerated Joan’s style of dress for her campaigns, it seems that Victorian authors are collectively unable to agree on whether her transvestitism—and in a few cases her military leadership—was appropriate. After having described the coronation at Rheims, one particular author remarks: “…as the grand object of her mission was now, by the will of Heaven, accomplished, she entreated his permission to return home, and resume those occupations and that course of life which became her sex,” (James, 34-35). Although the author issues abundant praise for Joan’s service to her country, like other biographers, Victorian ideology concerning the distinction between gender roles seems to surface. Another such example includes Gower’s reconstruction of Joan’s character during her trial, reaffirming the Victorian perception of women as members of the fairer and weaker sex: “Even Joan of Arc’s courage failed at that sight, and all the woman in her nature asserted itself,” (Gower, 232). Gower also notes that she “had not the defect of so many excellent but tedious women, who love talk for the mere sake of talking,” (6). Other biographical accounts convey the opposite, neglecting womanly expectations and solely depicting her as a beacon of unconquerable strength (Adams, 253).</p>
<p>Joan was one of the last to leave the battlefield of Compiègne, which resulted in her imminent capture on May 23rd, 1430. She had led a successful attack against the Burgundians until the English intervened and attacked the rear guard. Apparently, she would have made it to safety had not the drawbridge to the heavily fortified town of Compiègne been raised at the very last minute. She and a few of her closest aides stranded outside with her were promptly taken prisoner to Margny, the Burgundian camp. Strangely, according to Gower, Joan at certain instances demonstrated that she might have known about her fate beforehand:</p>
<p>‘My children and dear friends, I bid you to mark that I have been sold and betrayed and that I shall be shortly put to death. So I beseech you all to pray to God for me, for never more shall I be able to be of service to the King or to the Kingdom of France.’ (Gower, 126).</p>
<p>This appears to be another confirmation of her divinely inspired nature, as portrayed by select Victorian biographers. Gower also makes a curious statement that reflects the tendency to expound upon the “essence” of the biographical subject: “This story, whether authentic or not, is surely a touching one, is full of the spirit of the heroine,” (Gower, 126). Authenticity is not as important a factor as “the spirit of the heroine”, quite clearly. Any detail, as long as it eulogizes the subject in some way, is worthy of documentation.</p>
<p>The trial, which took place in Rouen from March 26 to May 24, 1431, conducted by Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais and was preceded by an interrogation lasting over 15 sessions. During interrogation, Joan was rigorously questioned about her birth, religious upbringing, visions, her manly garb, her military actions and even her virginity. Throughout the trial, Joan famously refused to swear an oath concerning the truthfulness of her answers to the judges: “You may ask me questions on which I shall be able to answer you, and on others about which I cannot,” (Gower, 158). After interrogation Joan of Arc was forced to endure torture locked in an iron cage for fifty days and nights. Nevertheless, she retained a great deal of dignity and mental clarity, speaking shrewdly and firmly in her defense. Her courage is certainly exalted in Victorian biography; for every factual detail there is a comment on her virtue and bravery. In one instance, Gower exclaims, “Glorious words, worthy of her who spoke them! They bear with them a heroic ring, and reveal with one sublime expression the very soul and spirit of Joan of Arc!” (192). Rousing, majestic expressions like “sublime” and “heroic” add to the already larger-than-life qualities attributed to her. Her noble character is contrasted against that of her captors, who are depicted as dastardly and devoid of morals: “No doubt can be entertained that she was a sacrifice to jealousy, in the first place, leaving hypocrisy and cruelty to do their part in the course of her trial-that mockery of justice and everlasting disgrace to all who bore a part in it,” (James, 43). This line embodies the sharp polarization of good and evil throughout these Victorian accounts. The sweeping descriptions, “sacrifice to jealousy” and “everlasting shame and infamy” have a sense of permanence that coincides with the prevalent religious overtone. There seems to be a clear delineation between the holy and the blasphemous.</p>
<p>The conclusion to the dramatic trial was her iconic, romanticized execution. Joan of Arc was condemned to burn at the stake on May 30, 1431, only six days after the trial ended. She was bullied into signing an abjuration stating that she would either wear women’s clothes or immediately burn at the stake. She was sexually assaulted only days after the abjuration and the perpetrators stole her clothes and left her with nothing to cover herself but men’s attire. When the Bishop noticed her garb, he immediately called for a meeting at the archiepiscopal chapel on the 29th of May in which all condemned her to death.</p>
<p>She died beautifully, firmly clutching a crude cross made of staves as the flames consumed her. Of course, a Victorian biographer would capitalize on the dramatic nature of her death, by exaggerating her heroic and Christ-like characteristics: “The crime of her martyrdom will ever rest, and surely no other crime but one in the world’s history can be paralleled with it,” (Gower, 252). Yet not all of them are overwhelmed with religious overtones. Biographer George James, for example, is a lot more secular in his approach: “In an enlightened age, her transcendently noble qualities, which were displayed in the best of causes, the just defence of her king and country, would have secured her universal admiration and gratitude; nor perhaps, can ancient or modern history furnish an example of such pure and exalted heroism,” (James, 62). This text in particular focuses on her personal bravery and attitude rather than her divinity. Also, the author takes the opportunity to opine on the superiority of his own enlightened era, and in conjunction does not refer to any form of spirituality. The biographies’ dissonant portrayal of Joan as either a heroic or divine figure (and in some instances a blend of the two) echoes the conflict between faith and secularism prominent in Victorian society.</p>
<p>From these differing depictions and viewpoints of these biographies, one can easily observe the extent to which Victorians diverged from one another on social ethics and belief systems. Joan of Arc, a focused straightforward character, is poked and prodded in multiple directions by these authors. To some, she is a true messenger of God and to others, she is merely a brave soul with an excitable imagination. Their biographies hold up a looking glass to an age when people simply could not decide whether to be spiritual or enlightened, whether to enforce gender roles or to blur the lines. However, these accounts undividedly devote themselves to eulogizing Joan and making it abundantly clear that her nature and deeds were to be venerated by all.</p>
