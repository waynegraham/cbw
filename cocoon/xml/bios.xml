                    <p>DOROTHY WYNDLOW PATTISON was born on January 15th, 1832. She was the youngest
                        daughter, and the youngest child but one, of the Rev. Mark Pattison, who was
                        for many years Rector of Hauxwell, near Richmond, in Yorkshire. She
                        inherited from her father, who was of a Devonshire family, that finely
                        proportioned and graceful figure which she always maintained; and from her
                        mother, who was the daughter of a banker in Richmond, those lovely features
                        which drew forth the admiration of everyone who had the pleasure of knowing
                        her.</p>

                    <p>Her father was a good and sincere man. He was thoroughly upright and
                        strict.</p>

                    <p>Dora and her sister, like a thousand other country parsons' daughters, were
                        of the utmost use in their father's Yorkshire parish. A French gentleman who
                        had lived a while in England and in the country, said to me one day:</p>

                    <p>"Your young ladies astound me. They are angels of mercy. They wear no
                        distinguishing habit; one does not see their wings, yet they fly everywhere,
                        and everywhere bring grace and love and peace - in my country such a thing
                        would be impossible."</p>

                    <p>These Pattison girls were for ever saving their pocket money to give it away,
                        and they made it a rule to mend and remake their old frocks, so as not to
                        have to buy new ones out of their allowance for clothes, so as to have more
                        to give. Even their dinners they would reserve for poor people, and content
                        themselves with bread and cheese." Giving to others instead of spending on
                        themselves seems to have been the rule and delight of their lives."</p>

                    <p>A pretty story is told of Dorothy at this time. A schoolboy in the village,
                        who was especially attached to her, fell ill of rheumatic fever. The boy's
                        one longing was to see "Miss Dora" again, but she was abroad on the
                        Continent. As he grew worse and worse, he constantly prayed that he might
                        live long enough to see her. On the day on which she was expected, he sat up
                        on his pillows intently listening, and at last, long before any-one else
                        could hear a sound of wheels, he exclaimed : "There she is!" and sank back.
                        She went to him at once, and nursed him till he died.</p>

                    <p>Her beauty was very great: large brilliant, brown eyes, full red lips, a firm
                        chin and a finely cut profile; her hair dark, and slightly curling, waved
                        all over her head; and the remarkable beauty and delicacy of her colouring
                        and complexion, added to the liveliness of her expression, made her a
                        fascinating creature to behold. Her father always called her "Little
                        Sunshine."</p>

                    <p>But the most remarkable feature about her was to be found in her inner being.
                        A will, which no earthly power could subdue, enabled her to accomplish an
                        almost superhuman work; yet at times it was to her a faculty that brought
                        her into difficulties. She was twenty-nine before she was able to find real
                        scope for her energies, and then she took a bold step--answered an
                        advertisement from a clergyman for a lady to take the village school. Her
                        mother had died in 1861, and she considered herself free from duties that
                        bound her to her home. Her father did not relish the step she took, but
                        acquiesced. She went to Woolston, and remained there three years, during
                        which time she won the hearts, not of the children only, but of their
                        parents as well. She had to live alone in a cottage, and do everything for
                        her self; but the people never for a moment doubted she was a real lady, and
                        always treated her with great respect.</p>

                    <p>Not thinking a little village school sufficient field for her energies, she
                        resolved to join a nursing sisterhood at Redcar, in Yorkshire. The life was
                        not quite suited to her strong will, but it did her good. She there learned
                        how to make beds and to cook. At first she literally sat down and cried when
                        the beds which she had just put in order were all pulled to pieces by some
                        superior authority, who did not approve of the method in which they were
                        made. But it was a useful lesson for her after life in a hospital. She was
                        there till the early part of 1865, and then was sent to Walsall to help at a
                        small cottage hospital, which had already been established for more than a
                        year.</p>

                    <p>Walsall, though not in the "Black Country," is in a busy manufacturing
                        district, chiefly of iron. At the time when Sister Dora went there it
                        contained a population of 35,000 inhabitants. It is now connected with
                        Birmingham by almost continuous houses and pits and furnaces.</p>

                    <p>As fresh coal and iron pits were being opened in the district around Walsall,
                        accidents became more frequent, and it was found impracticable to send those
                        injured to Birmingham, which was seven miles distant; Accordingly, in 1863,
                        the Town Council invited the Redcar Society to start a hospital there. When
                        the Sister who had begun the work fell ill, Sister Dora was sent in her
                        place, and almost directly caught small-pox from the outpatients. She was
                        very ill, and even in her delirium showed the bent of her mind by ripping
                        her sheets into strips to serve as bandages.</p>

                    <p>When the cottage hospital— which was the second of its kind in England — was
                        opened, the system of voluntary nursing was unknown; the only voluntary
                        nurses heard of then being those who had gone out to the Crimea with Miss
                        Florence Nightingale. Therefore a good deal of misunderstanding was the
                        result; but in the course of time people began to judge the institution by
                        its results. But Sister Dora, by her frank, open manner, disarmed suspicion,
                        while the sublime eloquence of noble deeds silenced tongues, and won for the
                        hospital the confidence of the public, and for herself the admiration and
                        affection of the people.</p>

                    <p>In 1866 she had a serious illness, brought on by exposure to wet and cold.
                        She would come home from dressing wounds in the cottages, wet through and
                        hot with hurrying along the streets, to find a crowd of outpatients awaiting
                        her return at the hospital, and she would attend to them in total disregard
                        of herself, and allow her wet clothes to dry on her.</p>

                    <p>This neglect occurred once too often; a chill settled on her, and for three
                        weeks she was dangerously ill. Then it was that the people of Walsall began
                        to realise what she was, and the door of the hospital was besieged by poor
                        people come to inquire how their "Sister Dora" was.</p>

                    <p>The hospital had moved men of every shade of politics, and every form of
                        religious belief, to the work, and there have been passages in its history
                        not pleasant to remember, but not one of these in the remotest degree
                        involved Sister Dora. On the contrary, her presence and counsel always
                        brought light and peace, and lifted every question into a higher sphere.
                        "Ask Sister Dora," it used to be said. "Had we not better send for Sister
                        Dora" some member would exclaim out of the fog of contention. Thereupon she
                        would appear; and many well remember how calmly self-possessed, and clear-
                        sighted she would stand -- never sit down. Indeed, there were those who
                        worked with her fifteen years who never saw her seated; she would stand,
                        usually with her hand on the back of the chair which had been placed for
                        her, every eye directed to her; nor was it ever many moments before she had
                        grasped the whole question, and given her opinion just as clearly and simply
                        and straight to the purpose as any opinion given to the sufferers in the
                        wards. Nor was she ever wrong; nor did she ever fail of her purpose with the
                        committee. No committeemen ever questioned or differed from Sister Dora, yet
                        in her was the charm of unconsciousness of power or superiority and the
                        impression left was of there being no feeling of pleasure in her, other than
                        the triumph of the right.</p>

                    <p>In 1867 the cottage hospital had to be abandoned, as erysipelas broke out and
                        would not be expelled. The wards were evidently impregnated with malignant
                        germs to such an extent that the committee resolved to build a new hospital
                        in a better situation.</p>

                    <p>Sister Dora's work became more engrossing when this larger field was opened
                        for it; the men's beds were constantly full, and even the women's ward was
                        hardly ever entirely empty.</p>

                    <p>Just at this period an epidemic of small-pox broke out in Walsall, and all
                        the energies of Sister Dora were called into play. She visited the cottages
                        where the patients lay, and nursed them or saw to their being supplied with
                        what they needed; whilst at the same time carrying on her usual work at the
                        hospital.</p>

                    <p>One night she was sent for by a poor man who was dying of what she called
                        "black-pox," a violent form of small-pox. She went at once, and found him in
                        the last extremity. All his relations had fled, and a neighbour alone was
                        with him. When Sister Dora found that only one small piece of candle was
                        left in the house, she gave the woman some money, begging her to go and buy
                        some means of light whilst she stayed with the man. She sat on by his bed,
                        but the woman, who had probably spent the money at the public house, never
                        returned; and after some little while the dying man raised himself up in bed
                        with a last effort, saying, "Sister, kiss me before I die." She took him,
                        all covered as he was with the loathsome disease, into her arms and kissed
                        him, the candle going out almost as she did so, leaving them in total
                        darkness. He implored her not to leave him while he lived, although he might
                        have known she would never do that. So she sat through the night, till the
                        early dawn breaking in revealed that the man was dead.</p>

                    <p>When the bell at the head of her bed rang at night she rose at once, saying
                        to herself, "The Master is come, and calleth for thee!" Indeed, she loved to
                        think that she was ministering to her Lord in the person of His poor and
                        sick.</p>

                    <p>Here is a letter from a former patient in the hospital, from which only a
                        short extract can be made:</p>

                    <p>"I had not been there above a week when Sister Dora found me a little bell,
                        as there was not one to my bed, and she said, 'Enoch, you must ring this
                        bell when you want sister.' This little bell did not have much rest, for
                        whenever I heard her step or the tinkle of her keys in the hall I used to
                        ring my bell, and she would call out, 'I 'm coming, Enoch,' which she did,
                        and would say, 'What do you want?' I often used to say, 'I don't know,
                        Sister," not really knowing what I did want. She 'd say, 'Do you want your
                        pillows shaken up, or do you want moving a little?' which she 'd do,
                        whatever it was, and say, 'Do you feel quite cosey now?' 'Yes, Sister.' Then
                        she would start to go into the other ward, but very often before she could
                        get through the door I 'd call her back and say my pillow was n't quite
                        right, or that my leg wanted moving a little. She would come and do it,
                        whatever it was, and say, 'Will that do?' 'Yes, Sister.' Then she 'd go
                        about her work, but at the very next sound of her step my bell would ring,
                        and so often as my bell rang Sister would come; and some of the other
                        patients would often remark that I should wear that little bell out or
                        Sister, and she'd say, 'Never mind, for I like to hear it, and it 's never
                        too often.' And it rang so often that I 've heard Sister say that she often
                        dreamt she heard my little bell and started up in a hurry to find it was a
                        dream."</p>

                    <p>Sister Dora said once to a friend, who was engaging a servant for the
                        hospital:</p>

                    <p>"Tell her this is not an ordinary house, or even a hospital. I want her to
                        understand that all who serve here, in whatever capacity, ought to have one
                        rule, <hi rend="italics">love for God</hi>, and then, I need not say, love
                        for their work."</p>

                    <p>She spoke often and with intense earnestness, on the duty, the necessity, of
                        prayer. It was literally true that she never touched a wound without raising
                        her heart to God and entreating him to bless the means employed. As years
                        glided away, she became able almost to fulfil the Apostle's command: "Pray
                        without ceasing." And her prayers were animated by the most intense faith —
                        an absolutely unshaken conviction of their efficacy. It may truly be said
                        that those who pray become increasingly more sure of the value of prayer.
                        They find that, whatever men may say about the reign of law and the order of
                        nature, earnest prayer does bring an answer, often in a marvellous manner.
                        The praying man or woman is never shaken in his or her trust in the efficacy
                        of prayer. She firmly held to the supernatural power, put into the hands of
                        men by means of the weapon of prayer; and the practical faithlessness in
                        this respect of the world at large was an ever-increasing source of surprise
                        and distress to her.</p>

                    <p>Since her death, in commemoration of her labours at Walsall, a very beautiful
                        statue has been there erected to her, and on the pedestal are bas-reliefs
                        representing incidents in her life there. One of these illustrates a
                        terrible explosion that took place in the Birchett's Iron Works, on Friday,
                        October 15, 1875, whereby eleven men were so severely burnt that only two
                        survived. All the others died after their admission into the hospital. It
                        came about thus: The men were at work when water escaped from the "twyer"
                        and fell upon the molten iron in the furnace and was at once resolved into
                        steam that blew out the front of the furnace, and also the molten iron,
                        which fell upon the men. Some suffered frightful agonies, but the shock to
                        the nervous systems of others had stupefied them. The sight and the smell
                        were terrible. Ladies who volunteered their help could not endure it, and
                        were forced to withdraw, some not getting beyond the door of the ward. But
                        Sister Dora was with the patients incessantly till they died, giving them
                        water, bandaging their wounds, or cutting away the sodden clothes that
                        adhered to the burnt flesh. Some lingered on for ten days, but in all this
                        time she never deserted the fetid atmosphere of the ward, never went to
                        bed.</p>

                    <p>She had so much to do with burns that she became specially skilful in
                        treating them. Children terribly burnt or scalded were constantly brought to
                        the hospital; often men came scalded from a boiler, or by molten metal. She
                        dressed their wounds herself, but, if possible, always sent the patients to
                        be tended at home, where she would visit them and regularly dress their
                        wounds, rather than have the wards tainted by the effluvium from the burns.
                        Her treatment of burnt children merits quotation.</p>

                    <p>"If a large surface of the body was burnt, or if the child seemed beside
                        itself with terror, she did not touch the wounds themselves, but only
                        carefully excluded the air from them by means of cotton wool and blankets
                        wrapped around the body. She put hot bottles and flannel to the feet, and,
                        if necessary, ice to the head. Then she gave her attention to soothing and
                        consoling the shocked nerves — a state which she considered to be often a
                        more immediate source of danger to the life of the child than the actual
                        injuries. She fed it with milk and brandy, unless it violently refused food,
                        when she would let it alone until it came round, saying that force, or
                        anything which involved even a slight further shock to the system, was worse
                        than useless. Sometimes, of course, the fatal sleep of exhaustion, from
                        which there was no awakening, would follow; but more often than not food was
                        successfully administered, and after a few hours, Sister Dora, having gained
                        the child's confidence, could dress the wounds without fear of exciting the
                        frantic terror which would have been the result of touching them at
                        first."</p>

                    <p>Children Sister Dora dearly loved; her heart went out to them with infinite
                        tenderness, and she was even known to sleep with a burnt baby on each arm.
                        What that means only those know who have had experience of the sickening
                        smell arising from burns.</p>

                    <p>Once a little girl of nine was brought into the hospital so badly burnt that
                        it was obvious she had not many hours to live. Sister Dora sat by her bed
                        talking to her of Jesus Christ and His love for little children, and of the
                        blessed home into which he would receive them. The child died peacefully,
                        and her last words were: "Sister, when you come to heaven, I'll meet you at
                        the gates with a bunch of flowers."</p>

                    <p>One of the most heroic of her many heroic acts was taking charge of the
                        small-pox hospital when a second epidemic broke out.</p>

                    <p>Mr. S. Welsh says: "In the spring of 1875 there was a second visitation of
                        the disease, and fears were entertained that the results would be as bad as
                        during the former visitation. One morning Sister Dora came to me and said,
                        'Do you know, I have an idea that if some one could be got to go to the
                        epidemic hospital in whom the people have confidence, they would send their
                        friends to be nursed, the patients would be isolated, and the disease
                        stamped out.'" This was because a prejudice was entertained against the new
                        small-pox hospital, and those who had sick concealed the fact rather than
                        send them to it. "I said," continues Mr. Welsh, "'I have long been of the
                        opinion you have just expressed; but where are we to get a lady, in whom the
                        people would have confidence, to undertake the duty?'</p>

                    <p>"Her prompt reply was, 'I will go.'</p>

                    <p>"I confess the sudden announcement of her determination rather took me by
                        surprise, for I had no expectation of it, and not the least remote idea that
                        she intended to go. 'But,' I said, 'who will take charge of the hospital if
                        you go there?'</p>

                    <p>"'Oh,' she replied, 'I can get plenty of ladies to come there, but none will
                        go to the epidemic. And,' she added, by way of reconciling me to her view,
                        'it will only be for a short time.'</p>

                    <p>"'But what if you were to take the disease and die?' I inquired.</p>

                    <p>"'Then,' she added, in her cheery way, 'I shall have died in the path of
                        duty, and, you know, I could not die better.'</p>

                    <p>"I knew it was no use pointing out at length the risk she ran, for where it
                        was a case of saving others, self with her was no consideration. I tried to
                        dissuade her on other grounds. . . A few days later I was in company with
                        the doctor of the hospital, who was also medical officer of health, and who,
                        as such, had charge of the epidemic hospital, near to which we were at the
                        time. He said, 'Do you know where Sister Dora is?' 'At the hospital I
                        suppose,' was my reply. 'No,' he rejoined, 'she is over there!' pointing to
                        the epidemic hospital. . . .</p>

                    <p>"The people as soon as they knew Sister Dora was in charge, had no misgiving
                        about sending their relatives to be nursed, and the result was as she had
                        predicted; the cases were brought in as soon as it was discovered that
                        patients had the disease, and the epidemic was speedily stamped out."</p>

                    <p>She had, however, a hard time of it there, as she lacked assistants. Two
                        women were sent from the work-house, but they proved of little use. The
                        porter, an old soldier, was attentive and kind in his way, but he always
                        went out "on a spree" on Saturday nights, and did not return till late on
                        Sunday evening. When the work-house women failed her she was sometimes alone
                        with her patients, and these occasionally in the delirium of small-pox.</p>

                    <p>It was not till the middle of August, 1875, that the last small-pox patient
                        departed from the hospital, and she was able to return to her original
                        work.</p>

                    <p>One of the bas-reliefs on her monument represents Sister Dora consoling the
                        afflicted and the scene depicted refers to a dreadful colliery accident that
                        occurred on March 14, 1872, at Pelsall, a village rather over three miles
                        from Walsall, by which twenty-two men were entombed, and all perished. For
                        several days hopes were entertained that some of the men would be got out
                        alive; and blankets in which to wrap them, and restoratives, were provided,
                        and Sister Dora was sent for to attend the men when brought to "bank." The
                        following extract, from an article by a special correspondent in a
                        newspaper, dated Dec 10, 1872, will give some idea of Sister Dora's
                        connection with the event:</p>

                    <p>Out of doors the scene is weird and awful, and impresses the mind with a
                        peculiar gloom; for the intensity of the darkness is heightened by the
                        shades created by the artificial lights. Every object, the most minute,
                        stands out in bold relief against the inky darkness which surrounds the
                        landscape. On the crest of the mound or pit-bank, the policemen, like
                        sentinels, are walking their rounds. The wind is howling and whistling
                        through the trees which form a background to the pit-bank, and the rain is
                        coming hissing down in sheets. In a hovel close to the pit shaft sit the
                        bereaved and disconsolate mourners, hoping against hope, and watching for
                        those who will never return. There, too, are the swarthy sons of toil who
                        have just returned from their fruitless search in the mine for the dear
                        missing ones, and are resting while their saturated clothes are drying.</p>

                    <p>But another form glides softly from that hovel; and amid the pelting rain,
                        and over the rough pit-bank, and through miry clay—now ankle deep—takes her
                        course to the dwellings of the mourners, for some, spent with watching, have
                        been induced to return to their homes. As she plods her way amid pieces of
                        timber, upturned wagons and fragments of broken machinery, which are
                        scattered about in great confusion, a "wee, wee bairn" creeps gently to her
                        side, and grasping her hand and looking wistfully into her face, which is
                        radiant with kindness and affection, says, "Oh, Sister, do see to my father
                        when they bring him up the pit." Poor child! Never again would he know a
                        father's love, or share a father's care. She smiled, and that smile seemed
                        to lighten the child's load of grief, and her promise to see to his father
                        appeared to impart consolation to his heavy, despairing heart.</p>

                    <p>On she glides, with a kind word or a sympathetic expression to all. One
                        woman, after listening to her comforting words, burst into tears—the
                        fountains of sorrow so long pent up seemed to have found vent. "Let her
                        weep," said a relative of the unfortunate woman; "it is the first tear she
                        has shed since the accident has occurred, and it will do her good to cry."
                        But who is the good Samaritan? She is the sister who for seven years has had
                        the management of the nursing department in the cottage hospital at
                        Walsall.</p>

                    <p>This is written in too much of the "special correspondent" style to be
                        pleasant; nevertheless it describes what actually took place.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Samuel Welsh says : "I remember one evening I was in the hospital when a
                        poor man who had been dreadfully crushed in a pit was brought in. One of his
                        legs was so fearfully injured that it was thought it would be necessary to
                        amputate it. After examining the patient, the doctor came to me in the
                        committee-room - one door of which opened into the passage leading to the
                        wards and another into the hall in the domestic portion of the building.
                        After telling me about the patient who had just been brought in, he said,
                        'Do you know Sister Dora is very ill? So ill,' he continued, 'that I
                        question if she will pull through this time.' I naturally inquired what she
                        was suffering from, and in reply the doctor said, 'She will not take care of
                        herself, and is suffering from blood-poison.' He left me, and I was just
                        trying to solve the problem — 'What shall be done? or how shall her place be
                        supplied if she be taken from us by death?' when I saw a spectral-like
                        figure gliding gently and almost noiselessly through the room from the
                        domestic entrance to the door leading to the wards. The figure was rather
                        indistinct, for it was nearly dark, and as I gazed at the receding form, I
                        said, 'Sister, is it you?' 'Whist!' she said, and glided through the doorway
                        into the wards. In a short time she returned, and I said to her, 'Sister,
                        the doctor has just been telling me how ill you are — how is it you are
                        here?' 'Ah!' replied she, 'it is true I am very ill; but I heard the
                        surgeons talking about amputating that poor fellow's limb, and I wanted to
                        see whether or not there was a possibility of saving it, and I believe there
                        is; and, knowing that, I shall rest better.' So saying, she glided as
                        noiselessly out of the room as when she entered.</p>

                    <p>"On her recovery - which was retarded by her neglecting herself to attend to
                        others — she called me one day to the hall-door of the hospital, and asked
                        me if I thought it was going to rain. I told her I did not think it would
                        rain for some hours. She then told me to go and order a cab to be ready at
                        the hospital in half an hour. I tried to persuade her not to venture out so
                        soon; but it was no use — she went; and many a time I wondered where she
                        went to.</p>

                    <p>"About six months afterward I happened to be at a railway station, and saw a
                        pointsman who had been in our hospital with an injured foot, but who, as his
                        friends wished to have him at home, had left before his foot was cured. I
                        inquired how his foot was. He replied that had it not been for Sister Dora
                        he would have lost his foot, if not his life. I said, 'How did she save your
                        foot when you were not in the hospital, and she was ill at the time you left
                        the hospital?' 'Well,' he replied, 'you know my foot was far from well when
                        I left the hospital; there was no one at our house who could see to it
                        properly, and it took bad ways, and one evening I was in awful pain. Oh, how
                        I did wish for Sister Dora to come and dress it! I felt sure she could give
                        me relief, but I had been told she was very ill, so I had no hope that my
                        earnest desire would be realised; but while I was thinking and wishing, the
                        bedroom door was gently opened, and a figure just like Sister Dora glided so
                        softly into the room that I could not hear her, but oh! she was so pale that
                        I began to think it must be her spirit but when she folded the bedclothes
                        from off my foot, I knew it was she. She dressed my foot, and from that hour
                        it began to improve.'</p>

                    <p>"A few days after this interview with the pointsman I was talking to Sister
                        Dora, and said: 'By the bye, Sister, I have found out where you went with
                        the cab that day.' She replied with a merry twinkle in her eye, 'What a long
                        time you have been finding it out!"</p>

                    <p>Her old patients ever remembered her with gratitude. A man called Chell, an
                        engine-stoker, was twice in the hospital under her care, first with a
                        dislocated ankle, severely cut; the second time with a leg crushed to pieces
                        in a railway accident. It was amputated. Ac-cording to his own account he
                        remembered nothing of the operation, except that Sister Dora was there, and
                        that, "When I come to after the chloroform, she was on her knees by my side
                        with her arm supporting my head, and she was repeating:</p>

                    <lg>
                        <l>" They climbed the steep ascent of heaven,</l>
                        <l>Through peril, toil and pain:</l>
                        <l>O God, to us may grace be given</l>
                        <l>To follow in their train.'</l>
                    </lg>

                    <p>And all through the pain and trouble that I had afterward, I never forgot
                        Sister's voice saying those words," When she was in the small-pox hospital,
                        avoided by most, this man never failed to stump away to it to see her and
                        inquire how she was getting on.</p>

                    <p>There were, as she herself recognised, faults in the character of Sister
                        Dora; and yet, without these faults, problematical as it may seem, it is
                        doubtful whether she could have achieved all she did.</p>

                    <p>One who knew her long and intimately writes to me "A majestic character,
                        brimming over with sympathy, but, for lack of self-discipline, this sympathy
                        was impulsive and gushing. Her glorious nature, physical and mental, was
                        marred by undisciplined impulse. Her nature found its congenial outlet in
                        devoted works of mercy and love to her fellow creatures. How far she would
                        have done the same under authority, I fear is a little doubtful."</p>

                    <p>Miss Twigg, who knew her well, writes me: "She was a lovable woman, so bright
                        and winsome. She used to come into our rather dull and sad home (our mother
                        died when we were quite children) after evening service, She would nurse one
                        of us, big as we were then, and the others would gather round her, while she
                        would tell us stories of her hospital life. . She was a real woman."</p>

                    <p>There is one point in Sister Dora's life to which sufficient attention has
                        not been paid by her biographers. It is one which the busy workers of the
                        present day think of too little—namely, the writing of bright, helpful
                        letters to any friend who is sick or in trouble. Somehow or other she always
                        found time for that, wrote one who knew her well, and who contributes the
                        following, written to a young girl who was at the time in a spinal hospital,
                        and who was almost a stranger to her:</p>

                    <p>MY Dear Miss J.—I was so glad to hear from you, though I fear it must be a
                        trouble for you to write. I do hope that you will really have benefited by
                        the treatment and rest. I am so glad that the doctor is good to his
                        "children." Such little attentions when you are sick help to alleviate
                        wonderfully. I wish-I could come and take a peep at you. Did Mrs. N. tell
                        you that she had sent us five pounds for our seaside expedition? Was it not
                        good of her? Oh! we shall have such a jolly time. To see all those poor
                        creatures drink in the sea-breezes! We have had s very busy week of
                        accidents and operations. It has been a rev. lar storm.* My dear, it is in
                        such times as you are now having that the voice of Jesus Christ can be best
                        heard, "Come into a desert place awhile." Know you surely that it is God's
                        visitation. Take home that thought, realise it: God visiting you, Elizabeth
                        was astonished that the Mother of her Lord should visit her. We can have our
                        Emmanuel, I can look back or my sicknesses as the best times of my life.
                        Don't fret about the future. He carrieth our sicknesses and healeth our
                        infirmities. You know infirmity means weakness after sickness. Think of the
                        cheering lines of our hymn: "His touch has still its ancient power." When I
                        arose up from my sick bed they told me I should never be able to enter a
                        hospital or do work again. I was fretting over this when a good friend came
                        to me, and told me only to take a day's burden and not look forward, and it
                        was such a help. I got up every day feeling sure I should have strength and
                        grace for the day's trial. May it be said of you, dear, "They took knowledge
                        of her that she had been with Jesus." May He reveal Himself in all His
                        beauty is the prayer of</p>

                    <p>Your sincere friend,</p>

                    <p>SISTER DORA.</p>

                    <p>It does not truly represent Sister Dora to dwell on her outer life, and not
                        look as well into that which is within, as it was the very mainspring of all
                        her actions, as it, in fact, made her what she was.</p>

                    <p>The same writer to the Guardian gives some sentences from other letters:
                        "Take your cross day by day, dearie, and with Jesus Christ bearing the other
                        end it will not be too heavy." "If we could find Jesus, it must be on a
                        mountain, not in the plains or smooth places," "He went up into a mountain
                        and taught them, saying," etc. "It is only on a mountain side that we shall
                        see the cross. It was only after Zacchaeus had climbed the tree he could see
                        Jesus. I have been thinking much of this lately. It is not in the smooth
                        places we shall see Jesus, it is in the rough, in the storm, or by the sick
                        couch." "A Christian is one whose object is Christ." "I am rejoiced that you
                        are enjoying Faber's hymns; they always warm me up. Oh, my dear, is it not
                        sad that we prefer . to live in the shade when we might have the glorious
                        sunshine?"</p>

                    <p>It was during the winter of 1876-77 that Sister Dora felt the first approach
                        of the terrible disease that was to cause her death, and then it was rather
                        by diminution of strength than by actual pain. She consulted a doctor in
                        Birmingham, in whom she placed confidence, and he told her the plain truth,
                        that her days in this world were numbered. She exacted from him a pledge of
                        secrecy, and then went on with her work as hitherto.</p>

                    <p>"She was suddenly brought, as it were, face to face with death-- distant,
                        perhaps, but inevitable; she, who was full of such exuberant life and spirit
                        that the very word 'death' seemed a contradiction when applied to her. Even
                        her doctor, as he looked at her blooming appearance, and measured with his
                        eye her finely made form, was almost inclined to believe the evidence of his
                        outward senses against his sober judgment. .</p>

                    <p>She could not endure pity. She, to whom everybody had learnt instinctively to
                        turn for help and consolation, on whom others leant for support, must she
                        now come down to ask of them sympathy and comfort? The pride of life was
                        still surging up in her, that pride which had made her glory in her physical
                        strength for its own sake, as well as for its manifold uses in the service
                        of her Master. True, she had been long living two lives in-separably
                        blended: the outward life of hard, unceasing toil; the inner, a constant
                        communion with the unseen world, the existence of which she realised to an
                        extent which not even those who saw the most of her could appreciate. To all
                        the poor, ignorant beings whose souls she tried to reach by means of their
                        maimed bodies, she was, indeed, the personification of all that they could
                        conceive as lovable, holy and merciful in the Saviour. At the same time she
                        judged her own self with strict impartiality. She knew her own faults, her
                        unbending will — her pride and glory in her work seemed to her even a fault;
                        and, in place of looking on herself as perfect she was bowed down with a
                        sense of her own short-comings. At the same time — with death before her,
                        she hungered for more work for her Master. His words were continually on her
                        lips: 'I must work the works of Him that sent me while it is day; the night
                        cometh when no man can work.'"</p>

                    <p>At last, in the month of August, 1878, typhoid fever having broken out in the
                        temporary hospital, it was found necessary to close it, and hasten on the
                        work of the construction of another. This gave her an opportunity for a
                        holiday and a complete change. She went to the Isle of Man, to London, and
                        to Paris.</p>

                    <p>But the disorder was making rapid strides, and was causing her intense
                        suffering, and she craved to be back at Walsall. She got as far as
                        Birmingham, and was then in such a critical state that it was feared she
                        would die. But her earnest entreaty was to be taken to Walsall. "Let me
                        die," she pleaded, "among my own people."</p>

                    <p>Mr. Welsh says: "On calling at the Queen's Hotel, Birmingham (where she was
                        lying ill), I was told the doctor of the hospital (Dr. Maclachlan) was with
                        her, and thinking they were probably arranging matters connected with the
                        hospital, I did not go to her room, but proceeded to the train. I had
                        scarcely got seated when the doctor called me out, and we entered a
                        compartment where we were alone. He asked me when it was intended to open
                        the hospital. I replied, 'On the 4th of November.' 'Then,' he said, 'that
                        will just be about the same time Sister Dora will die.'</p>

                    <p>"The announcement was to me a shock of no ordinary kind, for I had not heard
                        of her being ill, and no one could have imagined, from the cheerful tone of
                        a letter I had received from her a week or so before, that there was
                        anything the matter with her. Not being able to fully realise the true state
                        of affairs, I asked him if he were jesting. He replied he was not, and that
                        he thought it best to let me know at once, so that arrangements might be
                        made for getting someone to take her place when the hospital was opened. I
                        said, 'I suppose she is going to Yorkshire?' 'No,' he replied, 'and that is
                        another thing I wish to speak to you about. She wishes to die in Walsall,
                        and she must be removed immediately.</p>

                    <p>"On Sunday (the day following) I saw the chairman and vice-chairman of the
                        hospital. On Sunday evening I returned with Dr. Maclachlan to the Queen's
                        Hotel, where he found his patient very weak. On Mon-day morning a house was
                        taken, and the furniture she had in her rooms at the hospital removed to it.
                        Her old servant who had gone to The Potteries, was telegraphed for, and
                        arrived in a few hours, and by midday the house was ready for her reception.
                        My daughter, knowing Sister Dora's fondness for flowers, had procured and
                        placed on the table in the parlour a very choice bouquet; and when all was
                        ready Dr. Maclachlan drove over to Birmingham, and brought her to Walsall in
                        his private carriage.</p>

                    <p>"The disease was now making steady progress, and it was evident that every
                        day she was becoming weaker; but she never lost her cheerfulness, and anyone
                        to have seen her might have thought she was only suffering from some slight
                        ailment, instead of an incurable and painful disease."</p>

                    <p>"A few hours before her death," writes Mr. S. Welsh "she called me to her
                        bedside and said, 'I want you to promise that you will not, when I am gone,
                        write anything about me; quietly I came among you and, quietly I wish to go
                        away.'" And this desire of hers would have been faithfully complied with had
                        not misrepresentations fired the gentleman to whom the request was made to
                        take up his pen, not in defence of her, but in the correction of statements
                        that affected certain persons who were alive.</p>

                    <p>In her last sickness when she found her end approaching, she insisted on
                        every one leaving the room — it was her wish to die alone. And as she
                        persisted, so was it, only one nurse standing by the door held ajar, and
                        watching till she knew by the change of attitude, and a certain fixed look
                        in the countenance, that Sister Dora had entered into her test.</p>

                    <p>"It was Christmas Eve when she passed away, and a dense fog, like a funeral
                        pall, hung over the town and obscured every object a few feet from the
                        ground. Under this strange canopy the market was being held, and people were
                        busy buying and selling, and making preparations for the great Christmas
                        festival on the following day; but when the deep boom of the passing bell
                        announced the melancholy intelligence that Sister Dora had entered into her
                        rest, a thrill of horror ran through the people, who, with blanched cheeks
                        and bated breath, whispered, 'Can it be true?' Although for seven weeks the
                        process of dissolution had been going on before their eyes, they could not
                        realise the fact that she whom they loved and revered was no more."</p>

                    <p>The funeral took place on Saturday, the 28th of December. "The day was dark
                        and dismal, the streets, covered with slush and sludge caused by the melted
                        snow, were thronged with spectators. There was general mourning in the town,
                        and although it was market day nearly every shop was closed during the time
                        of the funeral, and all the blinds along the route of the procession were
                        drawn. . . . On reaching the cemetery it was found that four other funerals
                        had arrived from the workhouse; and as these coffins had been taken into the
                        chapel there was no room for Sister Dora's, which had, consequently, to be
                        placed in the porch. This was as Sister Dora would have wished, had she had
                        the ordering of the arrangements, for she always gave preference to the
                        poor, to whom she was attached in life, and from whom she would not have
                        desired to be separated in death."</p>

                    <p>True to her thought of others, in the midst of her last sufferings, she had
                        made arrangements for a Christmas dinner to be given to a number of her old
                        patients, in accordance with a custom of hers in previous years; but on this
                        occasion the festive proceedings were shorn of their gladness. All thought
                        of her who in her pain and on her deathbed had thought of them. Every one
                        tried, but ineffectually, to cheer and comfort the other, but the task was
                        hopeless. One young lady, after the meal, and while the Christmas tree was
                        being lighted commenced singing the pretty little piece, "Far Away," but
                        when she came to the words:</p>

                    <lg>
                        <l>Some are gone from us forever</l>
                        <l>Longer here they could not stay,</l>
                    </lg>

                    <p>she burst into tears; and the women present sobbed, and tears were seen
                        stealing down the cheeks of bearded men.</p>

                    <p>The Walsall writer of "A Review" concludes his paper thus:</p>

                    <p>She is no idol to us, but we worship her memory as the most saintly thing
                        that was ever given us. Her name is immortalised, both by her own surpassing
                        goodness, and by the love of a whole people for her—a love that will survive
                        through generations, and give a magic and a music to those simple words,
                        "Sister Dora," long after we shall have passed away. There was little we
                        could ever do—there was nothing she would let us do—to relieve the
                        self-imposed rigours of her life; but we love her in all sincerity, and now
                        !in our helplessness we find a serene joy in the knowledge that to her, as
                        surely as to any human soul, will be spoken the divine words: "Inasmuch as
                        ye have done it unto the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto
                        Me."</p>

                    <p>In Sister Dora, surely we have the highest type of the Christian life, the
                        inner and hidden life of the soul, the life that is hid in God, combined
                        with that outer life devoted to the doing of good to suffering and needy
                        humanity. In, the cloistered nun we see only the first, and that tends to
                        become self-centred and morbid ; it is redeemed from this vice by an active
                        life of self-sacrifice.</p>

                    <p>I cannot do better than, in conclusion, quote from the last letter ever
                        penned by Sister Dora:</p>

                    <p>"It is 2.30 A. M., and I cannot sleep, so I am going to write to you. I was
                        anything but 'forbearing,' dear; I was overbearing, and I am truly sorry for
                        it now. I look back on my life and see `nothing but leaves.' Oh, my darling,
                        let me speak to you from my deathbed, and say, watch in all you do that you
                        have a single aim — God's honour and glory. 'I came not to work my own work,
                        but the works of Him that sent me.' Look upon working as a privilege.. Do
                        not look upon nursing in the way they do so much nowadays, as an art or
                        science, but as work done for Christ. As you touch each patient, think it is
                        Christ Himself, and then virtue will come out of the touch to yourself. I
                        have felt that myself, when I have had a particularly loathsome patient. Be
                        full of the Glad Tidings, and you will tell others. You cannot give what you
                        have not got" </p>

                    <p>Preceding her canonization in <dateRange from="1920-01-01" to="1920-12-31"
                            >1920</dateRange>, the Victorian era experienced a revived interest in
                        the historical figure <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc</name>.
                        Because the biographical accounts written at the time reflect the various
                        ideologies of the age, one doesn’t know what to expect of her portrayal. Was
                        she illustrated as a divinely inspired prophetess or simply an imaginative
                        heroine? Universally, they regale her with flowery prose, depicting her as
                        an archetypal tragic heroine who is wronged by her contemporaries; however,
                        it seems that Victorian authors are unable to agree on the extent of her
                        holiness. Her secular self takes a back seat with her “divinity” pushed
                        beneath the spotlight in some instances, and in others the case is reversed.
                        Also, some authors comment on her adopting male conduct, wearing men’s
                        attire, and leading the men of the French military. Many authors state
                        outright what they feel to be appropriate behavior of a member of the
                        “fairer sex,” while others neglect the issue entirely. These discordant
                        viewpoints concerning <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc’s</name>
                        divinity and adherence to gender roles are reflective of the controversial
                        social issues prominent during the Victorian era.</p>

                        violent. The <rs type="place" key="country">French</rs> and the <rs
                            type="place" key="country">English</rs> were entangled in the Hundred

                            type="place" key="country">French</rs> throne unoccupied. In a desperate
                        attempt to assume the throne amidst the controversy concerning the
                        establishment of a legitimate heir, the <rs type="place" key="country"
                            >French</rs> and the <rs type="place" key="country">English</rs> entered
                        a war that would last for over a century. <name>Charles VI</name>, during
                        one of his bouts of insanity, had signed the Treaty of <rs type="place"
                            key="city">Troyes</rs> which ensured <rs type="place">English</rs> claim

                            VII</name>, the Dauphin, came to be seen as an illegitimate heir, while

                    <p><name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc</name> claimed to have experienced
                        visions from the time she was twelve, one of which included images of
                            <name>Saint Michael</name>, <name>Saint Catherine</name> and <name>Saint
                            Margaret</name> instructing her to rid <rs type="place" key="country"
                            >France</rs> of the <rs type="place" key="country">English</rs> and
                        restore the Dauphin to the throne. The means by which Victorian authors
                        attempt to explain this phenomenon are far from unanimous. For example,
                        while biographer <name>Lord Ronald Gower</name> continuously refers to
                            <name>Joan’s</name> “presences” as visions, <name>John Maskelyne</name>
                        refers to them as mere “hallucinations” and “illusions,”
                            (<name>Maskelyne</name>, 235). Biographer <name>William Adams</name> is
                        caught in the same dilemma, portraying the young <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC"
                            >Joan</name> as an impressionable child who was simultaneously directed
                        by God (<name>Adams</name>, 245-247).</p>
                    <p>In response to her visions, at sixteen years of age <name
                            corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan</name> requested that she be brought to
                            <name>Count Robert de Baudricourt</name> so that she might earn
                        permission to visit <name>Charles VII</name> at the royal court of <rs
                            type="place" key="city">Chinon</rs>. (She would have to be escorted
                        across enemy territory for the encounter with the Dauphin to take place). On
                        her second attempt she won the Count’s approval, as she managed to
                        accurately predict the result of the Battle of the Herrings.</p>
                    <p>News of <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan’s</name> visit spread quickly;
                        therefore, to test her divinity <name>Charles</name> dressed himself in
                        commoner’s clothing and adorned another in rich garb to mislead her. When
                        she arrived at court, however, she knelt before <name>Charles</name> instead
                        of the decoy, and despite <name>Charles'</name> denials, declared him the
                        true Dauphin: “‘In God’s name it is not they, but you, who are the King.
                        Most noble Dauphin, I am <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Jeanne</name> the Maid.
                        The Heavenly King sends me to help you and the realm; and to tell you that
                        you shall be anointed and crowned in the city of <rs type="place" key="city"
                            >Rheims</rs>, and that you shall reign as lieutenant of the Heavenly

                            (<name>Adams</name>, 250). Pulling him aside for a private
                        discussion—although there is no record of what was actually exchanged—she
                        managed to convince him to allow her to lead his army against the <rs

                    <p>After having been granted permission to assist in the command of the <rs

                            >Joan</name> deviated from traditional <rs type="place" key="country"
                            >French</rs> tactics of war and managed a series of victories against
                        the <rs type="place" key="country">English</rs>, acquiring the fortress of
                            <rs type="place" key="city">Saint Loup</rs> on <date>May 4, 1429</date>,
                        the fortress of <rs type="place" key="city">Saint Jean le Blanc</rs> on
                            <date>May 5</date>, the fortress of <rs type="place" key="city">Saint
                            Augustins</rs> on <date>May 6</date>, and on <date>May 7</date> the <rs
                            type="place" key="city">Orleans</rs> stronghold les Tourelles (an
                        achievement that left her with a wounded neck). She had another string of
                        victories in the month following, reclaiming <rs type="place" key="city"
                            >Jargeau</rs> on <date>June 12</date>, <rs type="place" key="city"
                            >Meung-sur-Loire</rs> on <date>June 15</date>, and <rs type="place"
                            key="city">Beaugency</rs> on <date>June 17</date>. She also had success
                        in the <date>June 18</date> Battle of <rs type="place" key="city"
                        >Patay</rs>, which would be the turning point of the Hundred Years’ War,
                        granting <rs type="place" key="country">France</rs> the lead against <rs
                            type="place" key="country">England</rs>. As a result of her success in
                        battle, she was able to accomplish one of the primary aims of her mission:
                        the coronation of <name>Charles VII</name> in <rs type="place" key="city"
                            >Rheims</rs> on <date>July 17</date>.</p>
                    <p>Throughout sieges, captures, and even <name>King Charles’</name> coronation,
                            <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan</name> wore the attire of a male
                        knight. Although the <rs type="place" key="country">French</rs> had
                        tolerated <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan’s</name> style of dress in her
                        campaigns, it seems that Victorian authors were unable to agree on whether
                        her transvestitism—and in a few cases her military leadership—was
                        appropriate. After having described the coronation at <rs type="place"
                            key="city">Rheims</rs>, one particular author remarks: "as the grand
                        object of her mission was now, by the will of Heaven, accomplished, she
                        entreated his permission to return home, and resume those occupations and
                        that course of life which became her sex” (<name>James</name>, 34-35). Like
                        other biographers, although he issues abundant praise for <name
                            corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan’s</name> service to her country, he still
                        adheres to Victorian ideology concerning the distinction between gender
                        roles. Another example is <name>Gower’s</name> reconstruction of <name
                            corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan’s</name> character during her trial,
                        reaffirming the Victorian perception of women as members of the fairer and
                        weaker sex: “Even <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc’s</name> courage
                        failed at that sight, and all the woman in her nature asserted itself”
                            (<name>Gower</name>, 232). <name>Gower</name> also notes that she “had
                        not the defect of so many excellent but tedious women, who love talk for the
                        mere sake of talking” (6). Other biographical accounts convey the opposite,
                        disregarding expectations of women and depicting her solely as a beacon of
                        unconquerable strength (<name>Adams</name>, 253).</p>
                    <p><name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan</name> was one of the last to leave the
                        battlefield of <rs type="place" key="city">Compiègne</rs>, resulting in her
                        imminent capture on <date>May 23rd, 1430</date>. She had led a successful
                        attack against the <rs type="place" key="country">Burgundians</rs> until the
                            <rs type="place" key="country">English</rs> intervened and attacked the
                        rear guard. Apparently, she would have made it to safety had not the
                        drawbridge to the heavily fortified town of <rs type="place" key="city"
                            >Compiègne</rs> been raised at the very last minute. She and a few of
                        her closest aides stranded outside with her were promptly taken as prisoners
                        to <rs type="place" key="city">Margny</rs>, the <rs type="place"
                            key="country">Burgundian</rs> camp. Strangely, according to
                            <name>Gower</name>, <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan</name> had at
                        certain instances demonstrated that she might have known about her fate
                        beforehand:</p>
                    <p>‘My children and dear friends, I bid you to mark that I have been sold and
                        betrayed and that I shall be shortly put to death. So I beseech you all to
                        pray to God for me, for never more shall I be able to be of service to the
                        King or to the Kingdom of <rs type="place" key="country">France</rs>’
                            (<name>Gower</name>, 126).</p>
                    <p>This appears to be another confirmation of her divinely inspired nature, as
                        portrayed by select Victorian biographers. <name>Gower</name> also makes a
                        curious statement that reflects the tendency to expound upon the “essence”
                        of the biographical subject: “This story, whether authentic or not, is
                        surely a touching one, is full of the spirit of the heroine,”
                            (<name>Gower</name>, 126). Authenticity is not as important a factor as
                        “the spirit of the heroine,” quite clearly. Any detail, as long as it
                        eulogizes the subject in some way, is worthy of documentation.</p>
                    <p>The trial, which took place in <rs type="place" key="city">Rouen</rs> from
                            <date>March 26</date> to <date>May 24, 1431</date>, was conducted by
                            <name>Pierre Cauchon</name>, Bishop of <rs type="place" key="city"
                            >Beauvais</rs> and was preceded by an interrogation lasting over fifteen
                        sessions. During interrogation, <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan</name> was
                        rigorously questioned about her birth, her religious upbringing, her
                        visions, her manly garb, her military actions and even her virginity.
                        Throughout the trial, <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan</name> famously
                        refused to swear an oath concerning the truthfulness of her answers to the
                        judges: “You may ask me questions on which I shall be able to answer you,
                        and others about which I cannot” (<name>Gower</name>, 158). After
                        interrogation <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc</name> was forced to
                        endure torture locked in an iron cage for fifty days and nights.
                        Nevertheless, she retained a great deal of dignity and mental clarity,
                        speaking shrewdly and firmly in her defense. Her courage is certainly
                        exalted in Victorian biography; for every factual detail there is a comment
                        on her virtue and bravery. In one instance, <name>Gower</name> exclaims,
                        “Glorious words, worthy of her who spoke them! They bear with them a heroic
                        ring, and reveal with one sublime expression the very soul and spirit of
                            <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc</name>!” (192). Rousing,
                        majestic expressions like “sublime” and “heroic” add to the already
                        larger-than-life qualities attributed to her. Her noble character is
                        contrasted with those of her captors, who are depicted as dastardly and
                        devoid of morals: “No doubt can be entertained that she was a sacrifice to
                        jealousy, in the first place, leaving hypocrisy and cruelty to do their part
                        in the course of her trial--that mockery of justice and everlasting disgrace
                        to all who bore a part in it” (<name>James</name>, 43). This line
                        illustrates the sharp polarization of good and evil in these Victorian
                        accounts. The sweeping descriptions “sacrifice to jealousy” and “everlasting
                        shame and infamy” have a sense of permanence that coincides with the
                        prevalent religious overtone. There seems to be a clear delineation between
                        the holy and the blasphemous.</p>
                    <p>The conclusion to the dramatic trial was her iconic, romanticized execution.
                            <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc</name> was condemned to burn at
                        the stake on <date>May 30, 1431</date>, only six days after the trial ended.
                        She was bullied into signing an abjuration stating that she would either
                        wear women’s clothes or immediately burn at the stake. She was sexually
                        assaulted only days after the abjuration and the perpetrators stole her
                        clothes and left her with nothing to cover herself but men’s attire. When
                        the Bishop noticed her garb, he immediately called for a meeting at the
                        archiepiscopal chapel on the <date>29th of May</date> in which all condemned
                        her to death.</p>
                    <p>She died beautifully, firmly clutching a crude cross made of staves as the
                        flames consumed her. Of course, Victorian biographers capitalized on the
                        dramatic nature of her death, by exaggerating her heroic and Christ-like
                        characteristics: “The crime of her martyrdom will ever rest, and surely no
                        other crime but one in the world’s history can be paralleled with it”
                            (<name>Gower</name>, 252). Yet not all of them are overwhelmed by
                        religious overtones. Biographer <name>George James</name>, for example, is a
                        lot more secular in his approach: “In an enlightened age, her transcendently
                        noble qualities, which were displayed in the best of causes, the just
                        defence of her king and country, would have secured her universal admiration
                        and gratitude; nor perhaps, can ancient or modern history furnish an example
                        of such pure and exalted heroism” (<name>James</name>, 62). This text in
                        particular focuses on her personal bravery and attitude rather than her
                        divinity. Also, the author takes the opportunity to opine on the superiority
                        of his own enlightened era, and does not refer to any form of spirituality.
                        The biographies’ dissonant portrayals of <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC"
                            >Joan</name> as either a heroic or divine figure (and in some instances
                        a blend of the two) echo the conflict between faith and secularism prominent
                        in Victorian society.</p>
                    <p>From the differing depictions and viewpoints of these biographies, one can
                        easily observe the extent to which Victorians diverged from one another in
                        social ethics and belief systems. <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of
                            Arc</name>, a focused straightforward character, is poked and prodded in
                        multiple directions by these authors. To some she is a true messenger of
                        God, and to others she is merely a brave soul with an excitable imagination.
                        Their biographies hold up a looking glass to an age when people simply could
                        not decide whether to be spiritual or enlightened, whether to enforce gender
                        roles or to blur the lines. However, these accounts undividedly devote
                        themselves to eulogizing <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan</name> and making
                        it abundantly clear that her nature and deeds were to be venerated by
                        all.</p>

                            >Fanny</name> ultimately saved her own family through her caricature of

                            to="1822-12-31">December 1822</dateRange>, left behind a rich legacy as
                        a journalist, women’s right activist, and social reformer when she passed

                            <name corresp="FRANCES_COBBE">Frances Power Cobbe</name> was in many
                        ways a remarkable woman. Living in the Victorian age when women had limited
                        access to gainful employment, and women writers were still something to be
                        scorned, <name corresp="FRANCES_COBBE">Cobbe</name> was a prolific author
                        and earned a living as a journalist for such reputable newspapers as the
                        Economist, the Spectator, the Contemporary Review, and Fraser’s Magazine.
                        For a time, she was also the second leader writer for the Echo. <name
                            corresp="FRANCES_COBBE">Cobbe’s</name> role as a contributor to these
                        newspapers afforded her a unique stage from which to campaign on behalf of
                        women’s suffrage, better educational opportunities for women and the poor,
                        and the anti-vivisection movement. </p>
                    <p><name corresp="FRANCES_COBBE">Frances Power Cobbe</name> began exercising her
                        philanthropic spirit at an early age. The only daughter of <name>Frances
                            Conway Cobbe</name> and <name>Charles Cobbe</name>, she was born into a
                        landowning Anglo-Irish family of some wealth and distinction. <name
                            corresp="FRANCES_COBBE">Cobbe</name> therefore had a comfortable
                        middle-class upbringing, and it provided her with opportunities to help
                        those in need. On her father’s <rs type="place" key="estate">Newberry</rs>
                        estate, for example, lived poor <rs type="place" key="country">Irish</rs>
                        tenants whose children the young <name corresp="FRANCES_COBBE"
                            >Frances</name> taught and cared for. <name>Deidre Rafferty</name>, in a
                        short biography of <name corresp="FRANCES_COBBE">Cobbe</name>, grounds <name
                            corresp="FRANCES_COBBE">Cobbe's</name> early philanthropic spirit on a
                        strong sense of noblesse oblige. That is, for the privileged <name
                            corresp="FRANCES_COBBE">Cobbe</name> there was a sense of duty and
                        obligation towards the less fortunate. It was possibly this same sense of
                        duty and obligation that influenced and compelled her interest in reform
                        movements. In her autobiography Life of <name corresp="FRANCES_COBBE"
                        />Frances Power Cobbe, <name corresp="FRANCES_COBBE">Cobbe</name> suggests
                        such a notion in regards to her interest in the campaign against domestic
                        violence: “in <dateRange from="1878-01-01" to="1878-12-31">1878</dateRange>
                        I was by chance reading a newspaper in which a series of frightful cases of
                        this kind were recorded…I got up out of my armchair, half dazed, and said to
                        myself: ‘I will never rest till I have tried what I can do to stop this”
                        (Life, 535). By <dateRange from="1881-01-01" to="1881-12-31"
                            >1881</dateRange>, <name corresp="FRANCES_COBBE">Cobbe</name> had
                        articulated this driving sense of duty in a new way. She explains in Duties
                        of Women that “it is quite possible to erect a general scheme of duty on the
                        sole ground of the inherent necessary rightfulness of one class of actions
                        and sentiments, and wrongfulness of another…” (Duties, 29).</p>
                    <p>As the only daughter in a family of five children, <name
                            corresp="FRANCES_COBBE">Cobbe</name> also experienced another kind of
                        duty and obligation-- one generally expected from the women of her time. As
                        a result of her mother’s grave illness, <name corresp="FRANCES_COBBE"
                            >Cobbe</name> returned home from her school in <rs type="place"
                            key="city">Brighton</rs> to take over the household chores. After her
                        mother, <name>Frances Cobbe Conway</name>, died in <dateRange
                            from="1847-01-01" to="1847-12-31">1847</dateRange>, when <name
                            corresp="FRANCES_COBBE">Cobbe</name> was twenty-five, the task of
                        running the household was left to her, and in the end she became her
                        father’s caretaker and companion until his death in <dateRange
                            from="1857-01-01" to="1857-12-31">1857</dateRange>. While <name
                            corresp="FRANCES_COBBE">Cobbe</name> was aware of the gender
                        implications of her domestic duty to her father, she nevertheless asserts in
                        her <dateRange from="1865-01-01" to="1865-12-31">1865</dateRange> work “The
                        Limits of Obedience in Daughters” that while parents have a right to demand
                        self-sacrifice from their children, the filial duty should be shared equally
                        by male and female children (Women, 105).</p>
                    <p>While <name corresp="FRANCES_COBBE">Cobbe’s</name> reform activities may have
                        been compelled by a sense of obligation and duty, her feminist beliefs were
                        greatly influenced by the works of the transcendentalist <name>Theodore
                            Parker</name>, and particularly his Discourse of True Religion.
                            <name>Parker’s</name> book “supported her belief in a rational God whose
                        moral law was revealed through human intuition” (Women, 98).
                            <name>Parker</name> also articulated that “in God, the parent of Good,
                        we have both parents in one” (<name corresp="FRANCES_COBBE">Frances Power
                            Cobbe</name>, 64); that is, God is both father and mother.

                        suggests that the minimal inheritance “indicated that her father had not
                        wished that she would live independently.” Rather he “had expected that

                            <name>Cobbe</name> believed this experience was integral to the

                    <p>During the <dateRange from="1860-01-01" to="1869-12-31">1860s</dateRange>,

                        on living animals for scientific purposes. In her influential article
                        “Celibacy vs. Marriage” which appeared in Fraser’s Magazine in <dateRange

                            >Cobbe</name> believed adamantly in the autonomy of women, but also

                        like purity and tenderness. This might appear to be a contradiction today,
                        and even at the time of <name corresp="FRANCES_COBBE">Cobbe’s</name> death
                        her breed of feminism was somewhat old-fashioned. Even though her writing

                            key="city">London</rs> Times, took notice of this: “Yet to a masculine

                        she joined an intensely womanly sympathy, which made her a practical and
                        most active philanthropist, whose chief mission in life it was to show a

                    <p><name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary Somerville</name> was an outstanding
                        mathematician and scientist of the Victorian period. Her scientific
                        contributions were doubly significant: not only was she a woman working
                        within a predominantly male domain, but modern science itself was a
                        fledgling field struggling to claim a place in Victorian culture. <name
                            corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary Somerville’s</name> enlightened work
                        helped to establish science as a distinct area of study in <rs type="place"
                            key="kingdom">Britain</rs>, and by the time of her death she was
                        well-known throughout <rs type="place" key="continent">Europe</rs> for both
                        her prodigious mathematical talents and her modest, polite, zealously
                        self-motivated personality. Curiously, <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE"
                            >Mary</name> was not a proficient reader until her early teens, and
                        encountered her first algebraic problem only by chance. Despite the many
                        objections from those attempting to deter her, and entirely through her own
                        machinations and determination, she became an extraordinary scientific
                        leviathan. </p>
                    <p><name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary Fairfax</name> was born on
                            <date>December 26, 1780</date>, not in her own home, but in that of her
                        mother’s sister. Her father was a vice-admiral in the <rs type="place"
                            key="kingdom">British</rs> Navy, sent to sea as a midshipman at scarcely
                        ten years of age. As he was so often absent, <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE"
                            >Mary’s</name> mother had decided to accompany him to his port of
                        departure in <rs type="place" key="city">London</rs>. In the throes of her
                        confinement, <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary’s</name> mother arrived at
                        her sister’s house in <rs type="place" key="town">Jedburgh</rs>, <rs
                            type="place" key="country">Scotland</rs> just in time to give birth to
                            <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name>. As <name
                            corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary’s</name> mother was ill following her
                        delivery, she was nursed by her aunt <name>Martha</name>, who also happened
                        to be the mother of her future husband (<name>Neeley</name> 23).</p>
                    <p><name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> grew up in <rs type="place"
                            key="kingdom">Fife</rs>, <rs type="place" key="country">Scotland</rs>,
                        in the “quiet, quaint little seaport village” (<name>Osen</name> 96) of <rs
                            type="place" key="town">Burntisland</rs>. The <name>Fairfax</name> house
                        and garden were close to the seashore, and <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE"
                            >Mary</name> spent much of her youth roaming the hillsides and coast
                        near her home, practically ignorant of the existence of mathematics. She
                        wrote in her autobiography: “I never cared for dolls, and had no one to play
                        with me,” (<name>Somerville</name> 18), and her solitary wanderings
                        cultivated within her a profound fascination with nature. <name
                            corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary’s</name> lifelong love of nature was
                        fueled by her devout faith in God, as her mother, according to <name
                            corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary’s</name> own account, “taught me to read
                        the Bible, and to say my prayers morning and evening; otherwise she allowed
                        me to grow up a wild creature” (<name>Somerville</name> 17). Her father,
                        upon returning home from one of his long voyages, was dismayed to find her
                        such a “savage,” hardly able to read or write at ten years of age, and he
                        immediately sent her to a fashionable boarding school in <rs type="place"
                            key="town">Musselburgh</rs> (<name>Osen</name> 97), though <name
                            corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> was “utterly wretched” there
                            (<name>Somerville</name> 21) and only remained for one year.</p>
                    <p>After her brief sojourn in formal education, <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE"
                            >Mary</name> returned home to <rs type="place" key="town"
                            >Burntisland</rs> and assumed control over her own education. She
                        studied Latin, arithmetic, and writing, with only the aid of her own
                        resourcefulness. In her mid-teens, the disapproval of her
                        traditionally-minded family supplanted <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE"
                            >Mary’s</name> ever-increasing appetite for education, and she was
                        forced to spend more of her time learning domestic arts. She became quite
                        proficient in playing piano, drawing, and needlework, and had an active
                        social life. It was at a tea party that she encountered her very first
                        algebra problem. <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> and a friend
                        were flipping through a fashion magazine when she spotted some algebraic
                        symbols that kindled her interest, and she resolved to investigate the
                        subject further (<name>Osen</name> 99 – 100). Although unassertive by
                        nature, <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> eventually managed to
                        obtain and study a copy of <name>Euclid’s</name> Elements of Geometry
                        despite familial reproach. Indeed, “her mother was appalled and shamed by
                        such aberrant behavior, and the servants were instructed to confiscate <name
                            corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary’s</name> supply of candles so that she
                        could not study at night” (<name>Osen</name> 102).</p>
                    <p>In <dateRange from="1804-01-01" to="1804-12-31">1804</dateRange>, <name
                            corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> married her cousin <name>Samuel
                            Greig</name>, a captain in the <rs type="place" key="country"
                            >Russian</rs> Navy. Though he had already served with distinction, <name
                            corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary’s</name> parents would not hear of her
                        moving to <rs type="place" key="country">Russia</rs>, so <name>Samuel</name>
                        left active service and became the <rs type="place" key="country"
                            >Russian</rs> consol for <rs type="place" key="kingdom">Britain</rs> in
                            <rs type="place" key="city">London</rs> (<name>Patterson</name> 3).
                        Finally removed from the intellectual confines of her conservative family’s
                        criticism, <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> was less inhibited in

                            >Mary</name> was at liberty to pursue her study of mathematics in

                        astronomy and natural science. She continued to advance her scientific
                        knowledge, slowly acquiring a small library as well as professional advice.
                        In <dateRange from="1812-01-01" to="1812-12-31">1812</dateRange> she married

                        she had three children, though only two survived infancy. In contrast to the

                        stated that “I simply translated <name>Laplace’s</name> work from algebra

                    <p>In <dateRange from="1853-01-01" to="1853-12-31">1853</dateRange>, the
                        twenty-eight-year-old <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Adelaide Anne
                            Procter</name> wrote a letter describing a peasant’s engagement party
                        she had attended in <rs type="place" key="country">Italy</rs>:</p>
                    <p>"We have been to a ball, of which I must give you a description. Last
                        Tuesday… we heard very distinctly a band of music, which rather excited my
                        astonishment… <name>Emily</name> said, ‘Oh! That band is playing at the
                        farmer’s near here. The daughter is fiancée to-day, and they have a ball.’ I
                        said, ‘I wish I was going!’ ‘Well,’ replied she, ‘the farmer’s wife did call
                        to invite us.’ ‘Then, I shall certainly go,’ I exclaimed… We were received
                        with great enthusiasm; the only drawback being, that no one spoke French… I
                        began to be afraid that some idea of our dignity might prevent my getting a
                        partner; so, by <name>Madame B.’s</name> advice, I went up to the bride, and
                        offered to dance with her… My [other] partner was a little man, like
                            <name>Perrot</name>, and very proud of his dancing. He cut in the air
                        and twisted about, until I was out of breath, though my attempts to imitate
                        him were feeble in the extreme… after seven or eight dances, I was obliged
                        to sit down. We stayed till nine, and I was so dead beat with the heat that
                        I could hardly crawl about the house… it is so long since I have danced.”
                            –<name>Dickens</name>, xvii-xix</p>
                    <p><name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Adelaide Anne Procter’s</name> exuberance in
                        this anecdote conflicts with popular assumptions that she had an intense
                        character, reflected in her role as a poet, advocate for women’s rights, and
                        member of a prominent literary family. A friend of the family described the
                        young <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter</name> as possessing a
                        “doomed” look about her, manifested in a “marked brow over heavy blue eyes"
                        and a “mournful expression for a little child” (<name>Gregory</name>, Life
                        and Work [LW], 5). However, <name>Dickens</name> provides us with a
                        contrasting view of <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name>
                        character as he writes that even on her deathbed “her old cheerfulness never
                        quitted her” (<name>Dickens</name>, xxiii). Though <name>Dickens</name>
                        proved to be a prominent advocate for <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER"
                            >Procter</name> and her works, one must wonder what he saw in the young
                        lady that few others did. These markedly different perceptions of <name
                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Adelaide Anne Procter’s</name> personality
                        only begin to relate all the ways she was, and is today, perceived by
                        critics and friends alike. </p>
                    <p><name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Adelaide</name> was born into the
                            <name>Procter</name> family in <rs type="place" key="city">London</rs>
                        on <date>October 30, 1825</date>, and she “grew up amid surroundings
                        calculated to develop her literary taste” (<name>Lee</name>, 1). Many family
                        friends perceived that she had a serious demeanor, as they would have
                        expected of the daughter of a well-respected poet. Her father, <name>Bryan
                            Waller Procter</name>, who published under the name <name>Barry
                            Cornwall</name>, was a lawyer and a poet so well regarded that he has
                        prominent placement in several short obituaries of his daughter. <name
                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> mother encouraged her
                        daughter’s interest in poetry by copying poems into a small album, which the
                        young girl carried “about like another little girl might have carried a
                        doll” (<name>Dickens</name>, xvi). <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER"
                            >Procter</name> grew up surrounded by important figures of literature
                        and reform, such as <name>William Makepeace Thackery</name>, <name>Charles
                            Dickens</name>, <name>Thomas Carlyle</name>, and <name>M. P. Benjamin
                            Leigh Smith</name> (<name>Hoeckley</name>, 2); however, as her
                        experience at the engagement party documents, she also enjoyed associating
                        with people outside her elite circle, and took pleasure in non-literary
                        pursuits.</p>
                    <p>Despite <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> familiarity with
                        the literary world, she refused to rely on her connections as she sought
                        publication. She even submitted her poetry to <name>Dickens’</name>
                        publication, Household Words, under the pseudonym “<name>Miss
                        Berwick</name>” (2). Her use of a female name (unlike authors such as
                            <name>Marian Evans</name> and the <name>Bronte</name> sisters who used
                        masculine pen names) can be seen as an early indication of her later
                        campaigns for women’s rights, becausse she promoted women’s entrance into
                        the male-dominated sphere of publication. <name>Dickens</name> himself was
                        unaware that <name>Miss Berwick</name>, whose poetry he frequently
                        published, was actually <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Adelaide Anne
                            Procter</name>, the daughter of a long-time family friend. One winter
                        day in <dateRange from="1854-01-01" to="1854-12-31">1854</dateRange>, as he
                        visited with the <name>Procter</name> family, he warmly praised the unknown
                        female poet whose work he had been publishing for two years (2). The
                        following evening, he learned that he had been praising “<name>Miss
                            Berwick</name>” in her presence (2). Until then, <name>Dickens</name>
                        and the Household Words staff had fantasized that this mysterious <name>Miss
                            Berwick</name> was a governess. He had so fully invented her character
                        that his “mother was not a more real personage to [him], than <name>Miss
                            Berwick</name> the governess became” (<name>Dickens</name>, xiv), but he
                        transferred his admiration for “<name>Miss Berwick</name>” to <name
                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Miss Procter</name>. Her use of a pseudonym
                        “strikingly illustrates the honesty, independence, and quiet dignity, of the
                        lady’s character” (xiv-xv) because she relied on her talent, rather than her
                        connections, to advance her art.</p>
                    <p><name>Dickens’</name> appreciation for <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER"
                            >Procter’s</name> poetry continued after he discovered her identity, and
                        over time she became his most published author (<name>Gregory</name>, <name
                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">A. Procter</name>, 1). <name>Dickens</name>
                        published her poetry not only in Household Words, but also All the Year
                        Round, another of his well-circulated periodicals (<name>Hoeckley</name>, 2;
                            <name>Lee</name>, 1). Although very few periodicals besides
                            <name>Dickens’</name> featured her work (<name>Drain</name>, 2), she had
                        ample opportunity to publish her poetry through <name>Dickens</name>. She
                        was the only poet whom he featured in his Christmas edition.
                            (<name>Gregory</name>, LW, 228). She published her own two-volume book
                        of poetry, Legends and Lyrics, in <dateRange from="1858-05-01"
                            to="1858-01-31">May of 1858</dateRange>, and both volumes were reprinted
                        in multiple editions. </p>
                    <p>Although <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter</name> found professional
                        success as an artist, her poetic ability is only one of many traits
                        distinguishing her from most Victorian women. She was raised as a
                        Protestant, but she and her sisters converted to Catholicism in <dateRange
                            from="1851-01-01" to="1851-12-31">1851</dateRange>, possibly influenced
                        by an Italian aunt (<name>Hoeckley</name>, 2). This conversion is
                        significant: because of the strong anti-Catholic sentiments throughout <rs
                            type="place" key="country">England</rs> at this time, so her conversion
                        shows strength of character. Some scholars speculate, however, that she had
                        already secretly adopted Catholicism two years earlier (<name>Drain</name>,
                        2), when she was twenty-four. <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER"
                            >Adelaide</name>may have waited to announce her decision until she had
                        her sisters’ support because her conversion complicated the initially strong
                        relationship between herself and her father (<name>Gregory</name>, LW, 10).
                        But whether she feared cultural or familial disapproval, her delay muddles
                        her iconic position as an independent woman. However, her Catholic faith led
                        her directly to passionate involvement with social work, arguably one of her
                        most progressive achievements.</p>
                    <p>Because of widespread bigotry against Catholics, <name
                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> conversion aligned her with
                        oppressed sectors of society, including working-class <rs type="place"
                            key="country">Irish</rs> Catholics (11). She supported the Providence
                        Row Night Refuge, which aided predominantly Catholic homeless women and
                        children (11). Her concern for the disenfranchised also led her to the
                        struggle for women’s rights, a cause she championed throughout her life. She
                        associated with other women who combined their artistic and cultural
                        interests with the advancement of women’s causes. These women frequently met
                        in each other’s homes to discuss marriage and property laws in the context
                        of women’s lives (<name>Hoeckley</name>, 3). Though they often met sexist
                        criticism meant to trivialize their cause (3), that attention also indicated
                        that their ideas posed a threat to the societal status quo.</p>
                    <p><name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter</name> used her success as a poet to
                        advance the causes for which she fought. Beyond writing for personal
                        enjoyment, she also dedicated her literary efforts to helping women in the
                        workplace. She united her passions for writing and reform through her work
                        in The <rs type="place" key="country">English</rs> Woman’s Journal, which
                        fought for women’s equality in education, employment, and property rights
                        (3). She used her poetic skills to provide a voice for the Catholic widows
                        and orphans she was helping through the Providence Row Night Refuge. While
                        working to support the Society to Promote the Employment of Women (SPEW),
                        she published <name corresp="QUEEN_VICTORIA">Victoria</name> Regia: a Volume
                        of Original Contributions in Poetry and Prose (3-4). This publication
                        supported the cause of female employment by using a printing company which
                        exclusively employed women (4). <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER"
                            >Procter’s</name> poetic success was not only a personal victory, but
                        also a way for her to advance her belief in social justice.</p>
                    <p>Despite her widespread publication, critical reception of her poetry was and
                        remains highly ambivalent. Even <name>Dickens</name>, <name
                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> most enthusiastic advocate,
                        was uneasy about the social aspects of her poetry. While declaring his
                        admiration for her style, he evinced some apprehension about those social
                        aspects (<name>Gregory</name>, LW, 197). He praised her philanthropic work
                        but avoided mentioning her official positions within liberal organizations
                        (197). Beyond her possibly controversial topics, a contemporary biographer
                        writes that her style of poetry was often “not only sentimental but also
                        formally simplistic” (<name>Hoeckley</name>, 5). <name>Procter</name>
                        herself admitted that “Papa is a poet. I only write verses.”
                            (<name>Drain</name>, 3) Despite its formal uninventiveness, her poetry
                        was popular because of its “invariably simple and direct language and
                        strongly affective rhetoric. This simplicity… masks a complexity of thought
                        and feeling” (<name>Gregory</name>, LW, 3-4). Critiques of her work,
                        accompanied with <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> own
                        humility, suggest that her poetry’s significance comes from its content
                        rather than its form or style.</p>
                    <p><name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> relationships within
                        feminist societies have led to speculations about her sexuality. Little is
                        known about her romantic and sexual liaisons. She was engaged at least once,
                        according to a letter from <name>William Makepeace Thackeray</name>, and
                        there is additional evidence that she was engaged to a man who devastated
                        her by breaking the engagement (21, 24). This latter incident probably
                        occurred two years before the <name>Thackeray</name> letter, although the
                        dating and details are so uncertain that this may be the same man (21, 24).
                        Despite these documented heterosexual relationships, rumors of her
                        lesbianism have persisted. Her friendship with <name>Matilda M. Hays</name>,
                        a co-editor of The <rs type="place" key="country">English</rs> Woman’s
                        Journal, may not have been platonic: “She dedicated the ‘First Series’ of
                        Legends and Lyrics to ‘<name>Matilda M. Hays</name>’. On the <date>23
                            January 1858</date>
                        <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter</name> wrote a poem titled ‘To
                        M.M.H’…It is a poem which expresses love for <name>Hayes</name>… who dressed
                        in men’s clothes and had lived with [a woman] in <rs type="place" key="city"
                            >Rome</rs>” (24-25). Other than the vaguely erotic nature of several of
                        her poems (254), there is little evidence about her romantic or sexual
                        life.</p>
                    <p>The intense activity and ceaseless work that made <name
                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter</name> remarkable contributed to her
                        early death at the age of thirty-eight. She was confined to her bed for the
                        last fifteen months of her short life as she suffered from consumption. It
                        is highly possible that her work among the sick exposed her to the
                        tuberculosis that killed her, although her intense work ethic rendered her
                        physically ill-equipped to fight the disease (<name>Hoeckley</name>, 5). She
                        died in the presence of her mother and sister in <rs type="place" key="city"
                            >London</rs> at the age of thirty-eight (<name>Dickens</name>,
                        xxiv).</p>
                    <p>Despite her passionate activism, her obituaries hailed her importance as a
                        poet and as her father’s literary heir. Her obituary in The Examiner lists
                        her poetic achievements with no mention of her social importance (The
                        Examiner). It fallaciously states that she died unexpectedly, despite her
                        fifteen months on bed rest (The Examiner). Her obituary in <rs type="place"
                            key="city">Liverpool</rs> Mercury Etc. falsely reports that she died “at
                        about thirty years of age” (<rs type="place" key="city">Liverpool</rs>).
                        Both of these inconsistencies romanticize her premature death. In another
                        obituary, published by an <rs type="place" key="country">Irish</rs>
                        newspaper, <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> Catholic faith
                        is celebrated above her achievements; the author claims that “The religious
                        no less than the literary world has good cause to lament [her] loss”
                        (Freeman’s). These early accounts of her life omit her social reform, while
                        contemporary biographers emphasize her importance as a woman’s advocate
                        above her merit as a poet. As society has recognized the importance of
                        women’s rights, this aspect of <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER"
                            >Procter’s</name> life has been more celebrated. These different
                        perceptions are possible because <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER"
                            >Procter</name> was such a rich character, with a young woman’s
                        cheerfulness, a poet’s intensity, an artistic vision, and a passion for
                        reform. </p>

                            Darling</name></title>
                        <bibl>From 'Lives of the Victorians' blog at Wordpress.com</bibl>
                    </head>
                    <p>At the dawn of the Victorian Era, one diminutive but brave young woman
                        captivated the national consciousness as a result of her role in a dangerous
                        rescue mission off the coast of <rs type="place" key="county"
                            >Northumberland</rs>. Her name was <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace
                            Darling</name>, and through her efforts in the rescue of nine
                        shipwrecked passengers early on the morning of <date>September 7,
                            1838</date>, she was transformed into an exalted national hero. She was
                        both lauded and hounded by the public up until her early death, after which
                        she, and her story, continued to entrance the public imagination.</p>
                    <p><name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace Darling</name> was born in <rs
                            type="place" key="village"/>Bamburgh, <rs type="place" key="county"
                            >Northumberland</rs> on <date>November 14, 1815</date>, and was the
                        seventh of <name>William</name> and <name>Thomasin Darling’s</name> nine
                        children. <name>William Darling</name> was a lighthouse keeper, as his
                        father had been before him, and <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>
                        and her siblings grew up on the “Longstone Light on one of the wild and
                        savage <rs type="place" key="archipelago"/>Farne islands”
                            (<name>Sitwell</name> 59). Relatively little is known regarding <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name> early years, though she seems to
                        have received a solid education evident in her handwriting, which was “equal
                        to that of most ladies” (<name>Bruce</name> 376). Furthermore, she was
                        surrounded by books, albeit those “principally [of] Divinity” and
                        “Geography, History, Voyages and Travels, with Maps” (<name>Mitford</name>
                        89). Her father regarded novels and other forms of literature, as well as
                        pursuits such as card-playing, to be the works of the Devil, and raised his
                        family within the confines of strict Puritanism (<name>Mitford</name> 89,
                            <rs type="place" key="city">Oxford</rs>). </p>
                    <p>In their remote location, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and her
                        family were isolated from society at large, making only occasional
                        excursions to the mainland, and otherwise occupying themselves with the
                        daily domestic duties of the lighthouse (<name>Bruce</name>). Perhaps as a
                        result of this confined but (for <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>,
                        apparently) enjoyable upbringing, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>
                        was “remarkable for a retiring and somewhat reserved disposition”
                            (<name>Bruce</name> 376). She assisted her father in his work on the
                        lighthouse and kept watch at times (<rs type="place" key="city"
                        >Oxford</rs>), bearing witness to several wrecks and rescues over the course
                        of her lifetime but never participating in them, as her older brothers were
                        always present to help their father (<name>Bruce</name>). </p>
                    <p>In this manner, for the first twenty-two years of her life, the mild-tempered
                        “young girl of five feet two, with small wrists” (<name>Sitwell</name> 61)
                        lived quietly in a household of sober industry and religious commitment. The
                        events of the early hours of <name>September 7, 1838</name>, however,
                        drastically expanded the confined world in which <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> lived, though they never seemed to
                        change her fundamental personality and temperament.</p>
                    <p>The Forfarshire, one of the largest steamships of its day, set off from port
                        on <date>September 6, 1838</date>, carrying around sixty people, crew and
                        passengers. Upon encountering a brutal storm near the <rs type="place"
                            key="archipelago">Farne Islands</rs>, the ship was wrecked on Big Harcar
                        Rock (<name>Mitford</name> 29). <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>,
                        keeping watch from the lighthouse, glimpsed the nine survivors at around
                        five o’clock on the morning of <date>September 7</date> and informed her
                        father (<name>Thomasin Darling</name>). Her older brothers had all left
                        their parents by then to live on the mainland, while her younger brother,
                        who was usually present at the lighthouse, was away on a fishing excursion
                            (<name>Mitford</name> 29). As a result, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING"
                            >Grace</name> was put in the unusual position of being the only
                        able-bodied assistant for her father. Most initial accounts of the story of
                        this day portray <name>William Darling</name> as reluctant and unwilling to
                        brave the stormy waters, while <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>
                        forced him into action by declaring her intention to go regardless of his
                        participation (<name>Sitwell</name>). Later accounts, however, have
                        questioned this depiction of the story, and the only firsthand written
                        account of the rescue is that of <name>William Darling</name> himself, in
                        the official letter he wrote to the Secretary of Trinity House. </p>
                    <p>His depiction of the rescue is a straightforward factual representation in
                        which he credits his “Daughter” with having “observed a vessel on Harker’s
                        Rock” and “incessantly [applying] the glass until near 7 o’clock when, the
                        tide being fallen [they] observed three or four men upon the rock.” He then
                        states that they “agreed that if [they] could get to them some of them would
                        be able to assist [them] back,” after which they “immediately launched
                        [their] boat, and [were] enabled to gain the rock.” <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and <name>William</name> then
                        returned to the Lighthouse with the sole woman and four of the men, two of
                        whom then returned with <name>William</name> to retrieve the remaining four
                        men (<name>William Darling</name>). The matter-of-fact attitude with which
                        these events were treated by the <name>Darling</name> family is evident in
                            <name>William Darling’s</name> account of the rescue. To a family of
                        lighthouse-keepers, dangerous rescues were fairly frequent occurrences, and
                        the efforts that <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and her father
                        put forth were expected and unremarkable. The rest of the nation, however,
                        did not perceive the event in such a pragmatic manner. Instead, the public
                        exalted the romantic and heroic nature of the event in a manner directly
                        opposed to the down-to-earth humility of the <name>Darlings’</name>
                        reaction.</p>
                    <p>The year <dateRange from="1838-01-01" to="1838-12-31">1838</dateRange>, one
                        year following the beginning of <name corresp="QUEEN_VICTORIA">Queen
                            Victoria’s</name> reign and its corresponding era, was a “moment [that]
                        was opportune for acclaiming female virtue” (Correspondent). Although <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and her father played equally
                        significant roles in the rescue of the survivors, it was <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and the combination of her
                        unconventional act and virtuous humility, emblematic of ideal Victorian
                        womanhood, that attracted the media and publicity. The number of visitors at
                        the Longstone Lighthouse increased exponentially as people from all over the
                        country flocked to meet the great heroine and see the location of her
                        selfless deed.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the masses that besieged the once reclusive world of Longstone
                        Lighthouse, numerous institutions celebrated the <name>Darling</name>
                        family. The Royal Human Society acknowledged <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING"
                            >Grace</name> and <name>William Darling</name> in a special general
                        court held on <date>October 31, 1838</date> that highlighted the
                        “intrepidity, presence of mind, and humanity that nobly urged
                            [<name>Grace</name>]” to rescue the survivors of the shipwreck
                            (<name>Thomasin Darling</name> 26). In addition to this acknowledgment,
                            <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and <name>William</name> each
                        received the society’s Golden Medallion, one of the highest honors of that
                        time. The Duke of <rs type="place" key="county">Northumberland</rs> was
                        chosen to deliver the honorific medallions, and he added to the delivery his
                        own gifts for the family: waterproof clothing, a silver teapot, a gold seal
                        engraved with <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name> initials, and
                        four pounds of tea. It was through this act of largesse that the lifelong
                        friendship between the Duke and <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>
                        began (<name>Thomasin Darling</name>).</p>
                    <p>Following the Royal Human Society’s lead, many other national and local
                        institutions recognized <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name>
                        actions. She received medals from The Royal Institution for the Preservation
                        of Life from Shipwreck, The <rs type="place" key="city">Edinburgh</rs> and
                            <rs type="place" key="district">Leith</rs> Humane Society, The <rs
                            type="place" key="city">Glasgow</rs> Humane Society, and The Shipwreck
                        Society of <rs type="place" key="city">Newcastle</rs>. Some organizations,
                        such as Llyods, an insurance market, and The Ladies of <rs type="place"
                            key="city">Edinburgh</rs>, chose to send money and stocks to <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and her father. Just a year after
                        the shipwreck, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> had received about
                        seven hundred and fifty pounds' worth of stock (<name>Thomasin
                            Darling</name>). </p>
                    <p>Medals, stocks, and money were not the only gifts that <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and her family received. Admirers
                        sent a plethora of treasures that included silver tea sets, jewelry, and
                        even a beaver bonnet. The number of presents received by the family, despite
                        its immensity, was insignificant in comparison to the number of letters sent
                        to the lighthouse. Many people wrote simply to praise <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>, demonstrating the public
                        fascination surrounding her. Others wrote to describe how they had lost
                        loved ones in shipwrecks and to thank <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING"
                            >Grace</name> for preventing others from suffering the same loss. <name
                            corresp="QUEEN_VICTORIA">Queen Victoria</name> herself recognized and
                        contributed to <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name> national
                        prominence when the <name>Darlings</name> received a letter from the <rs
                            type="place" key="kingdom">United Kingdom’s</rs> Treasury stating that
                        “Her Majesty [had] been called to the circumstances attending the Wreck of
                        the Forfarshire Steamer” and wished to acknowledge <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> for her actions in saving the
                        survivors (<name>Thomasin Darling</name> 30). Amongst all of these letters,
                        however, there is no evidence that <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING"
                            >Grace</name> ever received acknowledgement from the survivors of the
                        Forfarshire’s wreck (<name>Thomasin Darling</name>).</p>
                    <p><name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> attempted to reply to every letter
                        and gift she received. She usually declined any admiration or gratitude,
                        insisting that she was simply God’s instrument, and that therefore it was
                        God who deserved the thanks. Many people wrote to <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> asking for a signature or lock of
                        her hair, leading her to begin enclosing locks of hair in her responses as a
                        means of repayment for the recognition she received (<name>Thomasin
                            Darling</name>). This custom soon ended, however, as <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> “would soon have been left with a
                        closely cropped head” had her attempts to satisfy the demanding public
                        continued in this manner (<name>Thomasin Darling</name> 47).</p>
                    <p>Despite this sudden burst of popularity and fame, <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> “shrank from, not courted, the
                        public” (<name>Thomasin Darling</name> 38), behavior that simultaneously
                        reinforced the Victorian conception of her virtuous nature and characterized
                        her as a shy and wild creature threatened by the hungry public
                            (<name>Sitwell</name>). <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>
                        received many offers to be properly introduced to <rs type="place"
                            key="city">London’s</rs> society, some including paid appearances, but
                        she refused all of them. The Duke of <rs type="place" key="county"
                            >Northumberland</rs>, now a family friend and patron, understood <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name> reluctance to embrace her fame
                        and worked to spare her from undesired exhibition. When <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> received letters requesting her
                        appearance at various ceremonies and functions, she informed the Duke and he
                        wrote politely worded refusals on her behalf. Eventually, people began to
                        write to the Duke in order to pass messages on to <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>. Grateful for this understanding
                        and help, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> called the Duke her
                        Guardian and herself his servant (<name>Thomasin Darling</name>).</p>
                    <p>The Duke was not able to shield <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>
                        from the artistic community, however. The events of that September morning
                        seized the artistic imagination of the era, and painters such as <name>J.W.
                            Carmichael</name> and <name>Thomas Musgrave Joy</name> requested that
                            <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and her father sit for
                        portraits. Many times, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> would be
                        forced to reenact awkward positions in order for the painters to properly
                        portray the scene of the Forfarshire’s shipwreck. There were also many books
                        dedicated to <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name> story. Many of
                        them were written as romances, with loose treatment of the facts of the
                        event. <name>William Wordsworth</name> commemorated <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and her actions in verse considered
                        to be beautifully and poetically written, but also greatly romanticized and
                        “embarrassing” (<rs type="place" key="city">Oxford</rs>). <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> did not read or pay attention to
                        any of the novels, in keeping with her strict upbringing (<name>Thomasin
                            Darling</name>).</p>
                    <p>She continued to “politely refuse” all offers of paid appearances
                        (Correspondent) and to decline invitations to enter into <rs type="place"
                            key="city">London</rs> society, as <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING"
                            >Grace</name> was content to focus on her chores and duties at Longstone
                        and to remain a companion and helper to her parents. She refused numerous
                        offers of marriage following her rise in fame (<name>Bruce</name>), and
                        “clung to her father and to her name, [explaining] that any husband of hers
                        should take it” (<name>Thomasin Darling</name> 11). She showed no
                        indications of yearning for something more than what she had, and refuted
                        the assumption that her quiet life on the island was unfulfilling, stating
                        that she “[had] no time to spare” as she had “seven apartments in the house
                        to keep in a state fit to be inspected every day by Gentlemen, so that [her]
                        hands [were] kept very busy” (<name>Mitford</name>, 89 and 90). Despite the
                        external clamor and demands of the public, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING"
                            >Grace</name> was satisfied with the quiet confinement, humble industry,
                        and familial duty of the lighthouse. </p>
                    <p>In this way, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> lived contentedly at
                        the Longstone Lighthouse until a sudden decline in her health occurred after
                        a visit to her oldest brother on <rs type="place" key="Island">Coquet
                            Island</rs> in <dateRange from="1842-01-01" to="1842-12-31"
                            >1842</dateRange>. In the hope of improving her condition, <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name> parents sent her and her sister,
                            <name>Thomasin</name>, to visit a family friend, <name>George
                            Shield</name>, in <rs type="place" key="town">Wooler</rs>
                            (<name>Thomasin Darling</name>, <rs type="place" key="kingdom"
                            >Britain</rs> Unlimited). While there, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING"
                            >Grace</name> wrote to her parents that she greatly enjoyed spending
                        time with her sister and was beginning to feel better.
                            <name>Thomasin’s</name> letters contradicted <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name> claim, however, as she wrote that
                        her sister’s coughs remained about the same (<name>Thomasin
                        Darling</name>).</p>
                    <p>The two sisters then went to <rs type="place" key="town">Alnwick</rs>, the
                        residence of the Duke of <rs type="place" key="county">Northumberland</rs>,
                        as the Duke had requested that <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> be
                        treated by his personal doctor. <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name>
                        health never improved, however, and the doctor said that her disease was one
                        which “no skill, nor care, nor kindness could arrest” (<name>Thomasin
                            Darling</name> 56). In one last attempt to save their daughter, the
                            <name>Darlings</name> sent <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> to
                            <name>Thomasin’s</name> home in <rs type="place" key="village"
                            >Bamborough</rs>. Much to everyone’s surprise, <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> began to show signs of increasing
                        health within the first few days in <rs type="place" key="village"
                            >Bamborough</rs>. Despite this short-lived hope, <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> died several days later on
                            <date>October 20th, 1842</date> at the age of twenty-seven, a victim of
                        what is believed to have been tuberculosis (<name>Thomasin Darling</name>,
                            <rs type="place" key="kingdom">Britain</rs> Unlimited). She was buried
                        in St. Aidan’s Churchyard, less than one hundred yards from where she had
                        been born (<rs type="place" key="kingdom">Britain</rs> Unlimited). </p>
                    <p>Though <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> was dead, her fame lived on
                        in literature, art, popular culture, and, most significantly, the national
                        consciousness. As <name>Edith Sitwell</name> put it, “to the last day of her
                        life <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace Darling</name> could not see that
                        she had done anything extraordinary…but she became the pride of the nation”
                            (<name>Sitwell</name> 62). To the Victorian Era, <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> stood as an emblem of both <rs
                            type="place" key="kingdom">British</rs> courage and female virtue that
                        resonated deeply with that era's imperialism and idealism. She was a woman
                        with a truly “<rs type="place" key="country">English</rs> heart”
                            (<name>Mitford</name>) who represented the absolute best of her society,
                        and gave its members hope and faith in a time of transition. </p>
