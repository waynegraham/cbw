                            <p>Margaret Lonsdale's seminal biography about the life and work of
                                Sister Dora. The first ("Copyright") edition, vol. 1911 in
                                Collection of British Authors, Leipzig: Tauchnitz, 1880 (with "The
                                right of translation is reserved," this was a standard imprint to
                                establish copyright), has the epigraph from Spenser and the
                                frontispiece portrait of Sister Dora that is adapted in many
                                illustrations; it is essentially the photograph credited to Mrs.
                                Williams, Wolverhampton, in our "carousel" above. Unlike later
                                editions, the first edition presents this frontispiece above a
                                printed script "signature" of the subject and at the bottom of the
                                page an illegible (apparently holograph) identification of the
                                image. Lonsdale in the preface (in later editions, "Preface to the
                                First Edition") faults this portrait: "Mr. Jeens was seriously ill
                                when he undertook it," so it lacks the "spirit" of the living
                                original and the photograph (Little, Brown, 1880: iii-iv). This
                                preface also explains that Lonsdale has preferred to avoid the "many
                                stories...possessing an element of the marvellous, nay, of the
                                supernatural, which would have made her biography sensational, as
                                well as more interesting....I never heard one of these stories from
                                her own lips"; they arose from "the veneration...by the ignorant and
                                the superstitious, as well as by the credulous among the educated"
                                (iv-v).</p>
                            <p>"Preface to the Fourth Edition," dated January 31, 1880, notes
                                deletions of letters (included in second and third editions)
                                concerning Sister Dora's deathbed conversion: she in fact "never
                                became a member of the Roman Catholic Church" (268). Lonsdale has
                                also removed mention of autopsy (vii-viii). She alludes to an outcry
                                against her in Walsall, and insists that Sister Dora wanted her own
                                life to be written; in final "justification," Lonsdale adds that
                                this life is "public property," not the exclusive treasure of
                                Walsall (viii-ix). With these alterations, the American editions are
                                "From the Sixth English Edition," and those in 1880-1881 through
                                1914 (32nd ed.) appear to use identical plates, though pagination
                                varies depending on whether it begins with front matter or chapter
                                one. London: Kegan Paul, 1881 omits the preface to the fourth
                                edition.</p>

                        wife was induced to commit him to an asylum for almost a year in 1834-1835.
                        The eldest son, <name type="brother">Mark Pattison</name>
                        <date>(1813-1884)</date>, became an Oxford don and for a time joined the
                        high-church Oxford Movement. The father tried to cut off all communication
                        between the nine sisters at home and this supposed Papist infection, though
                        Mark fostered Dorothy's education and she was often his companion on
                        holidays and visits. Many biographies depict a happy childhood for the
                        somewhat frail but beautiful child, said to be called her father's "Little
                        Sunshine." Dorothy is said to have "inherited from her father, who was of a
                        Devonshire family, that finely proportioned and graceful figure... and from
                        her mother...those lovely features which drew forth the admiration of
                        everyone who had the pleasure of knowing her" (M + S, 241). The sisters were
                        occupied in caring for their ailing mother, works of charity among the
                        villagers, and outdoor exercise, including Dorothy's great pleasure, riding
                        to hounds. Yet the father gave formal education to his two sons only,
                        resisted all suitors and disowned the daughters who married, and tried in
                        every way to contain his daughters and wife within the home and according to
                        his will. Biographies of Dorothy emphasize her innate strong will, source of
                        the greatness as well as the difficulties of her life.</p>
                    <p>Although Dorothy wished to join Florence Nightingale as a nurse during the
                        Crimean War (1853-1856), her father forbade her to leave home, pointing out
                        that without training, she would be "worse than useless" on the front. Most
                        biographies omit what the ODNB matter-of-factly understates: "Tall and
                        pretty, Dorothy Pattison was in love with several men during her life, both
                        before and after she took religious vows." An engagement to a handsome
                        farmer and soon another to a respectable clergymen both came to nothing,
                        under the disapproval of her family and her own reluctance to give up her
                        vocation for anything less than passion. After Dorothy's mother died in
                        1861, Dorothy won the great point of independence, serving as village
                        schoolmistress at Little Woolston, Buckinghamshire, for three years. There,
                        "She had to live alone in a cottage, and do everything for her self; but the
                        people never for a moment doubted she was a real lady, and always treated
                        her with great respect" (M + S 242).</p>
                    <p>One of her frequent illnesses led her to take a holiday to recuperate at
                        Coatham, near Middlesborough, where she visited an Anglican sisterhood and
                        observed their work in a convalescent home. In September 1864 she joined the
                        Christ Church sisterhood, adopting the name Sister Dora. Most accounts
                        stress her humiliation under the housework and impersonal discipline, though
                        she has already prided herself on being able to cook. Many accounts tell of
                        her bursting into tears "when the beds which she had just put in order were
                        all pulled to pieces by some superior authority, who did not approve of the
                        method in which they were made" (M + S 242). The sisterhood trained and then
                        dispatched nurses to small hospitals and private patients, and for some
                        years Sister Dora's assignments frequently changed. In January 1865 she was
                        sent to Walsall, a manufacturing district near Birmingham, where a small
                        cottage hospital had been formed in 1863 for emergency treatment of
                        industrial injuries from the coal mines, iron pits, tanneries, and railways.
                        Her decision to join the sisterhood meant a breach with her family, who
                        considered the work demeaning; Mark disapproved of her "romance" with
                        self-sacrifice. Many biographies repeat the idea that the sisterhood
                        prevented her from attending her father's deathbed and funeral (1865), and
                        that this led to her decision to leave the sisterhood. More recent accounts
                        make it clear that the breach with the sisterhood came later, when she made
                        her own decisions about her nursing assignments, and that bad relations with
                        her family as well as mistimed messages led to her not going home at that
                        time.</p>
                    <p>The first appearance of volunteer nurses, resembling Catholic nuns, caused
                        some distrust, and there are anecdotes about local people believing that
                        secret rituals were performed in a closed-off room in the hospital, or about
                        one boy who threw a stone that hit Sister Dora on the forehead, calling her
                        a "Sister of Misery." But soon professional men and workers all were won
                        over by Sister Dora's beauty, humor, graceful manners, and dedicated hard
                        work. By 1867, when a new hospital had to be built, Sister Dora was put in
                        charge, and clearly demonstrated her administrative skills as well as her
                        increasing expertise in treating wounds and illnesses. Religion infused
                        everything she did, from prayers and songs to the stories she told and
                        letters she wrote explaining her vocation, but evidently it was a
                        non-sectarian, populist form of belief that attracted her patients and
                        helped them to recover. She often said when a patient's bell would wake her
                        in the night, "The Master is come, and calleth for thee!" She once wrote to
                        a friend, who was engaging a servant for the hospital, "this is not an
                        ordinary house, or even a hospital...all who serve here...ought to have one
                        rule, <hi rend="italics">love for God</hi>, and then, I need not say, love
                        for their work."</p>
                    <p>All biographies of Sister Dora assemble the picture of an admirable
                        personality, some pushing the limits of credibility toward the heights of
                        sainthood. At the same time, almost all note the flaw that she herself
                        acknowledged, self-will. But without her driving sense of purpose and
                        resistance to obstacles, "it is doubtful whether she could have achieved all
                        she did," as Mabie and Stephen put it (following Lonsdale and Baring-Gould).
                        Women who came to Walsall to study nursing with her (she often had
                        "lady-pupils") objected that she would not let anyone help her and did not
                        delegate well, even that she had little appreciation of women. From a later
                        perspective, Sister Dora seems to have gained power through a version of
                        self-denial not dissimilar to an eating disorder or suicidal tendencies; the
                        famous risks she took with infections make more sense as ways to court death
                        when her own desires were defeated.</p>
                    <p>As noted, the biographies downplay Sister Dora's series of attachment to
                        suitors; most seem unaware of any such possibilities of marriage, though
                        some note that she was severely tested by her love for a medical man,
                        possibly Redfern Davies, whom she met in Walsall, her equal in many
                        qualities but an unbeliever. After a struggle, she decided to continue her
                        vocation and sustain her dedication to Jesus. Only since the 1930s have
                        letters reappeared that reveal that Sister Dora had a relationship in 1876
                        with a younger man, an industrialist, Kenyon Jones. Jo Manton considers
                        Sister Dora "the prisoner of her own legend" (306); she had to keep their
                        love a secret. The legend drew upon the beauty, purity, and gentility of a
                        lady, but her vocation permitted considerable bodily intimacy and
                        participation in graphic scenes and physical tasks unusual for the type.</p>
                    <p>There are several episodes of her intimacy with dying or wounded men that
                        combine sympathy, horror, and iconic heroism. One night she came to the home
                        of a man who was dying of small-pox; all his relatives and neighbors had
                        fled, including a woman she had sent to buy a candle, who never returned. As
                        she sat with the man, he asked her, "Sister, kiss me before I die." And as
                        the candle expired, she embraced the man, with his running sores, and sat
                        with him in the darkness all night, finding in the morning that he had died
                        in her arms. Another favorite narrative tells of a boy whose right arm had
                        been crushed by machinery. The surgeon insisted that it must be amputated to
                        save the boy's life, but Sister Dora wished to try to save the limb that
                        meant the boy's livelihood. The surgeon warned her (some accounts consider
                        him offended by her challenge to his authority)that the life of the patient
                        was her responsibility. With three weeks' constant care and prayer to heal
                        the wound, the arm became whole and healthy, and we are told the surgeon was
                        impressed, as the boy was forever grateful. He is said to have gained the
                        nickname "Sister's Arm." There are less common but equally uplifting
                        episodes of her counselling a young dying girl or befriending a convalescent
                        child who never forgot her care; children figure more generally as testimony
                        to Sister Dora's nurturing love. Walsall was full of former patients and
                        family members who remembered her generous, personal care and who would come
                        to see how she was during any illness. Every Sunday "Sister's Arm" would
                        walk many miles to the hospital to ask for Sister Dora, and say "Tell her
                        it's <hi rend="italics">her arm</hi> that rang the bell" (Fawcett
                        190-91)</p>
                    <p>Sister Dora worked with little pause throughout the day and night, visiting
                        all beds, supervising all meals, often skipping her own food or rest. She
                        was seldom seen sitting down. This work was enlivened with a sense of
                        performance and playfulness, singing and telling tales that entertained her
                        patients, whom she gave nicknames and special notice or favors. Yet the work
                        was repeatedly interrupted by serious illness; she seemed careless about
                        infection, coming in contact with all kinds of disease and exposed to all
                        weathers. </p>
                    <p>Other than her illnesses, her years of service in Walsall are shaped by
                        memorable catastrophes for the workers in the town, events featured in the
                        vividly realist bas-reliefs surrounding the base of the statue that Walsall
                        erected after her death. One was colliery disaster in 1872, and another was
                        an explosion in 1875 of a furnace at Birchett's Iron Works which covered
                        eleven men in molten metal. For ten days without resting Sister Dora bravely
                        tended to the victims in a special ward that pupil-nurses and doctors were
                        loath to enter, faced with the stench, the cries, and the sight of charred
                        bodies. Only two men survived. Yet another heroic episode came with a
                        renewed epidemic of small-pox; to convince the people to go to a quarantine
                        hospital, Sister Dora volunteered to place herself in isolation there. She
                        showed no concern for her own risk, but it meant many months of hard labor
                        because there were only a few unreliable servants.</p>
                    <p>Contemporary newspapers before and after her death began to record the
                        remarkable deeds of this self-sacrificing servant of the suffering poor. Her
                        medical colleagues attested to her skill in various branches of care, from
                        surgery to the dressing of wounds to the treatment of eye injuries; late in
                        life she studied the work of Lister on antiseptic treatment in London, but
                        she had chosen not to pursue further medical training in favor of her
                        particular hands-on mission among the workers. This mission included
                        rounding up prostitutes and clearing out the pubs for midnight prayer
                        meetings in the town. Many locals recalled her with reverence as a kind of
                        saint, and some believed she could work miracles. Gifts and testimonials
                        included a pony and cart given to her by railway men; she used it to make
                        house calls, and to take convalescents on jaunts. She particularly liked to
                        use her own funds to sponsor feasts for patients and holidays for the poor
                        children who were recovering from illness or injury. She hid the records of
                        the extent of her charities.</p>
                    <p>For many months she also kept secret her mortal illness, an inoperable breast
                        cancer, continuing to work as long as she could and planning the
                        construction and move into a new hospital that was begun in 1877. Here, a
                        passage in Baring-Gould and Mabie and Stephen offers a portrait of the
                        heroine's motives: <quote>She could not endure pity. She, to whom everybody
                            had learnt instinctively to turn for help and consolation, on whom
                            others leant for support, must she now come down to ask of them sympathy
                            and comfort? The pride of life was still surging up in her, that pride
                            which had made her glory in her physical strength for its own sake, as
                            well as for its manifold uses in the service of her Master. True, she
                            had been long living two lives inseparably blended: the outward life of
                            hard, unceasing toil; the inner, a constant communion with the unseen
                            world, the existence of which she realised to an extent which not even
                            those who saw the most of her could appreciate. To all the poor,
                            ignorant beings whose souls she tried to reach by means of their maimed
                            bodies, she was, indeed, the personification of all that they could
                            conceive as lovable, holy and merciful in the Saviour. (M+S 259)</quote>
                        After a brief holiday, she returned to Walsall in her final illness, and
                        died on 24 December, 1878. Her last wish, they say, was to die alone. And
                        some said, and had to be convinced otherwise, that she converted to
                        Catholicism on her deathbed.</p>
                    <p>Her funeral on the 28th of December was a town spectacle, a procession of
                        thousands. In 1886, a statue by Francis Williamson was erected in another
                        public ceremony, following upon a stained-glass window in St. Matthew's
                        Church (1882-1883). </p>
                    <p>The Walsall writer of "A Review," quoted by Baring-Gould and Mabie and
                        Stephens, concludes:</p>
                    <quote>She is no idol to us, but we worship her memory as the most saintly thing
                        that was ever given us. Her name is immortalised, both by her own surpassing
                        goodness, and by the love of a whole people for her—a love that will survive
                        through generations, and give a magic and a music to those simple words,
                        "Sister Dora," long after we shall have passed away. There was little we
                        could ever do—there was nothing she would let us do—to relieve the
                        self-imposed rigours of her life; but we love her in all sincerity, and now
                        in our helplessness we find a serene joy in the knowledge that to her, as
                        surely as to any human soul, will be spoken the divine words: "Inasmuch as
                        ye have done it unto the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto
                        Me."(M + S 264)</quote>
                    <p>Sister Dora's reputation as a modern saint was international for some
                        decades. She appeared in as many as twenty collective biographies besides
                        numerous biographical reference works and countless essays and articles. And
                        even Susan McGann's 2004 biography in ODNB ends with this same quotation
                        from Matthew 25:40.</p>

                        Wordsworth's "Ode on the Installation of His Royal Highness Prince Albert as
                        Chancellor of the University of Cambridge in 1847," a kind of fairytale
                        musical (15). The "Quartet" ends with Time's prophecy that Victoria will be
                        that rare sovereign who enjoys the blessing of love. Carey's unimaginatively
                        chronological and royalist biography wishes to maintain the tone of
                        Wordsworth's occasional poem,<milestone unit="subject" corresp="history"

                        lengthy short biography, "Childhood and Youth," "Victoria the Good," leads

                        linked to a history of the British monarchy, specifically the precedent of a

                    <p>A tale of royal progress can have the stilted pace of a processional, as the
                        presenter lines up events and sources. But grand proceeding is belied by the
                        indiscriminate accumulation of details and unidentified quotations.
                        according to a leveling standard of relevance or significance. Thus Thus
                            <name>Carey</name> signals no modification of interest or affect when
                        running through her information: the baptism of Princess Alexandrina

                        Carey juxtaposes the father's death with the vitality of the future queen,
                        dwelling on a sentimental anecdote (without attribution): <rs
                            type="narrative_elements" key="anecdote">"There is a sweet word-picture
                            here; for we are told that the royal infant, 'being held up at the

                            sported and laughed joyously, and patted the glass with her pretty
                            dimpled hands, in happy unconsciousness of her melancholy
                            bereavement.'...how vividly one seems to see it!"</rs>(18).</p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_rhetoric" ana="emphasis"/> The
                        anecdote uncannily anticipates many public spectacles of Victoria's joy and
                        grief, and even anticipates something of the disproportion between occasion
                        and feeling that many witnessed in her later life.</p>
                    <p>Carey makes her own public display of disproportionate affect in the effort
                        to shape a narrative about the living Queen. She frequently relies on direct
                        address, emphasis, cliched tropes and topoi, and other narrative rhetoric
                        and conventions of biography as a genre. Thus, the fifth and sixth
                        paragraphs, each a sentence long:</p>

                        for us again and again; and some never-to-be-forgotten picture is placed
                        before our eyes&mdash;...rich with nature's verity, and warm with
                        colour. </p>
                    <p rend="block"> Every writer who has striven to pourtray the leading incidents
                        of Queen Victoria's life has seized eagerly on these little

                            ana="episode"/> which seem to stand out with cameo-like clearness, and

                    <p>Biographers hungry for incident find these cameos nevertheless difficult to
                        arrange and display. Each treasured event hints that it might have been mass
                        produced. How to avoid the effect of a curtain rising again and again? The
                        national audience rehearses and performs sentiments memorized over a
                        collective lifetime of the Queen's reign. But Carey finds it worthwhile to
                        quote anecdotes by eminent witnesses of the royal childhood. "The great
                        philanthropist <name>William Wilberforce</name> writes to <name
                            corresp="HANNAH_MORE">Hannah More</name>, on <date>July 21st,
                            1820</date>" of an invitation to wait on the Duchess of Kent. "'She
                        received me with her fine animated child on the floor beside her with her
                        playthings, of which I soon became one.' The life at Kensington Palace was
                        as simple as that of any English household" (18). The future queen is
                        capable of making fond fools of statesmen, it seems&mdash;or of making a
                        domestic scene a model of the nation. This national home is at once cosy
                        (Princess and mother always share a bedroom) and bucolic (on summer days,
                        they take their simple breakfast outdoors among flowers and birds); run like
                        clockwork, it is an infallible program of self-improvement. Several sources
                        attribute national well-being to the disciplined program that kept Victoria
                        morally in tune, albeit lonely and a bit taxed with surveillance (19). </p>

                        many a child would boast; ...There is much splendour, but much
                        responsibility.' The Princess, having lifted up the forefinger of her right
                        hand, gave me that little hand, saying, 'I will be good, dear Lehzen; I will
                        be good.'"<milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_rhetoric"
                            ana="example"/> Lehzen recalls that Victoria said she would be glad if
                        Adelaide (wife of Willim IV) gave birth to an heir in place of Victoria,
                        since the queen was so fond of children. Carey, supporting the thesis of
                        Baroness Lehzen's letter, "One must surely allow that these were remarkable
                        words to be spoken by a child of twelve" (21).</p>
                    <p>Carey's next theme is the excellent plan of the Duchess of Kent to raise a
                        truly English daughter,<milestone unit="subect" corresp="narrative_rhetoric"

                        rosy, royalist picture nevertheless reveals discord, even as Carey blends
                        the voices of biography, history, and fiction for girls. The Princess was
                        presented at <rs corresp="places" ana="court">Court</rs> on Queen Adelaide's
                        birthday, on <date>February 24th, 1831</date> but was conspicuously absent
                        at the coronation of William IV. Carey perceives nothing controversial in
                        Parliament's designation of the Duchess of Kent as Regent,<milestone
                            unit="subject" corresp="history" ana="government"/> granting annual
                        support totalling £16,000 (22-23), and appears mystified by King William's
                        "painful" outburst at his own birthday dinner praying to survive till the
                        Princess would be of age to rule, to avoid a regency "in the hands of a
                        person near me, who is surrounded by evil advisers, and who is herself
                        incompetent to act with propriety in the station in which she would be
                        placed." The Princess was commanded in future to "appear at Court on all
                        occasions" (24).</p>
                    <p>The romance plot for this princess has more than usual inevitability. The
                        Duchess of Kent invited the Duke of Coburg and his sons Ernest and Albert
                        for a visit of "nearly four weeks at Kensington Palace, and the cousins
                        spent delightful days together, playing duets on the piano, sketching,
                        walking and riding, and visiting the chief attractions of the <rs

                        All parties wished the match to be, if possible, one of voluntary,
                        companionable love (24-25). Carey concludes her first chapter when Victoria
                        comes of age in May, 1837, the public celebrations followed quickly by the
                        death of William IV.</p>
                    <p>The second chapter, "Accession and Marriage," begins with two well-known

                        with children'" of the court. Dinner convenes at 7:30 but the Queen "seldom
                        appears before eight" (33-34). Victoria "would not allow the gentlemen to
                        remain over their wine more than a quarter of an hour, but always remained
                        standing in the drawing-room until they appeared. Coffee was then served,
                        and after the Royal hostess had said a few words to each of her guests, the

                        Melbourne always seated at her left hand, and at half-past eleven the Queen

                        self-reproach for having kept the prince in suspense for years: Victoria
                        writes, <rs corresp="narrative_elements" key="quotation_writing_by_subject"

                            put all idea of marriage out of her mind, which she now most bitterly
                            repents.' All these maidenly doubts and scruples were to vanish,
                            however, before the irresistible feeling inspired by the Prince when
                            they met again" </rs>(35). Carey relies on Victoria's letters to King
                        Leopold and Baron Stockmar, statements of private feeling clearly
                        communicating a matter of international political concern. The young woman
                        feels guilty for her recent resolution not to marry, but confesses <rs

                        Prince Albert's own diplomatic letter to his grandmother confirms that the
                        love was mutual; Carey interrupts excerpts of it to exclaim, "Could anything
                        be more idyllic in its simplicity and guileless reality than this betrothal
                        of the 'sweet Flower of May' to the princely Sir Galahad, so true to the
                        motto of his house, '<hi rend="italics">Treu und Fest</hi>'" (37). After an

                        afterwards wrote: 'For '"the poor little bride" there was no lack of those

                        uttered the vow. The honeymoon at Windsor, Albert's sad parting from father
                        and brother, the departure of the Duchess of Kent to her own residence in
                        turn bring Carey's narrative to a new phase: "And so the ideal married life
                        began; the maiden monarch no longer stood <milestone unit="subject"
                            corresp="narrative_rhetoric" ana="trope_alone"/>alone—she had now a

                        her. No one who saw them could doubt that it was a marriage of profound
                        happiness and true sympathy, and the good Queen had her peerless

                        (41). The chapter concludes with quatrains of a supposed song by a Scottish
                        "peasant girl" recalling the <milestone unit="subject" corresp="history"

                        national spirit, shared emotion, are all condensed in the pseudo-ballad. </p>
                    <p>Like previous chapters, the third chapter begins with dual
                        titles&mdash;"Married Life" and "Wife and Mother"&mdash;and a
                        prestigious epigraph (this one from Tennyson on the good influence of
                        Victoria as "Mother, Wife and Queen"). The marital happiness of Victoria and
                        Albert counterbalances "the trammels of etiquette and the wearisome routine
                        and burdensome duties of a court"; "the youthful pair set a noble example"

                        palace with the happy princess, here Carey imports eyewitness testimony, a
                        letter quoted in a biography of Prince Albert, written by "one of the
                        artists employed in decorating a pavilion in the garden of Buckingham

                    <p>Chronology motivates Carey's text to move from one line to the next, but the
                        theme of Victoria's supreme virtues in contrast to "jaded worldlings" (44)
                        brings to mind, abruptly in the next paragraph, the moral improvements of
                        the entire Victorian age. "The Queen's influence on the stage was
                        wonderfully beneficial; as <name>Mrs. Oliphant</name> observes, <rs

                        a sweet smile on his face. In short, his care of her was like that of a

                    <p>Knowing that the royal family is prolific and that Victoria and Albert are
                        happy until his unexpected death, the reader begins to feel that the
                        biography of this monarch is more wearying than the duties and ceremonies of
                        court. But perhaps contemporaries took personal interest in the annals of
                        childbirth and holidays for this family of celebrities. The text draws on
                        correspondence and journals for glimpses of domestic life. The <rs

                            ana="quotation_writing_by_subject"/>"The Queen writes in her Journal:
                        'To think we have two children now, and one who enjoys the sight already
                        (the Christmas-tree); it is like a dream.' And again, in a pretty, maternal
                        way, 'Albert brought in dearest little Pussy (Princess Victoria) in such a
                        smart white merino dress, trimmed with blue' and sitting together as a
                        family of four gave her a feeling of happiness (45-46). Carey presupposes
                        Victoria's maternal devotion&mdash;"What true womanly
                        words!"&mdash;but recent biographers have recalled that Victoria's
                        journals and letters indicate her general dislike of motherhood. </p>
                    <p>A modern reader might wonder about Carey's silence on subjects that usually
                        consitute "history." This is characteristic of contemporary short
                        biographies of the Queen, which credit her with the spirit of her age but
                        reduce that age to a few outline events. Rather abruptly, Victoria's
                        domestic idyll gains a background of conditions of some but not all
                        "troubles" of <date>1842</date> (famine being unmentioned). "There was
                        terrible news from <rs corresp="places" key="nation">Afghanistan</rs>, and

                        Plantagenet Ball.'" The impertinence of a festival of consumption (and
                        anachronism) to address an economic crisis persists in the life of Queen
                        Victoria, with Carey's stamp of approval. </p>
                    <p> Also in <date>1842</date>, Victoria survived two assassination attempts,
                        showing "the utmost courage," and leniency toward her attackers (47). The
                        Queen's "first railway journey" (47) initiates a series of journeys,
                        particularly the holidays to Scotland, punctuating the catalogue of children
                        born and relatives died. Once the text has identified the complete series of
                        royal children, Carey devotes some paragraphs to the theme of child-rearing
                        and education, largely through extended quotation of other biographies. Thus
                        "that charming book, 'The Private Life of the Queen,' by one of Her
                        Majesty's servants, tells us that the Queen 'always made time in her busy
                        life to bathe with her own hands the last new baby'" (49). <rs

                            principles of her own upbringing, "simplicity," "discipline,"

                            instructors in languages and arts, and conscientious religious training

                    <p>Carey's attention seems surprisingly occupied by biographies of Prince
                        Albert, as if sharing the Queen's infatuation. He was the Queen's "truest
                        advisor and counsellor," and she camed to "lean more on that strong arm and
                        bright intellect" (50). It was Albert who oversaw the design and growth of
                        the island home, Osborne. And of course it was Albert who devised the

                        this day's festival was a thousand times superior." Victoria's writing calls
                        the opening of the Exhibition "The proudest and happiest day of... my happy
                        life. . . . To see this great conception of my beloved husband's mind, which
                        is always labouring for the good of others, to see this great thought and
                        work crowned with triumphant success" (52-53).</p>
                    <p>The awkward intermingling of family events and historical events continues.
                        In <date>1854</date>, Victoria declared <rs corresp="history"
                            key="international_war">war with Russia</rs>, a source of "consuming
                        anxiety" (54). "The Queen suffered so keenly for her soldiers, that one of
                        the Royal children said to Lord Cardigan, when he came to Windsor, <rs
                            corresp="narrative_elements" key="speech_others">'You must hurry back to

                        following paragraphs adjoin news of the birth of the last child, engagement
                        of the first, and "the awful tidings of <rs corresp="history"
                            key="international_war">the Indian Mutiny</rs>....And again the Queen's
                        womanly sympathies were strongly excited by the terrible details of
                        Cawnpore. On the Princess Royal's wedding day the Queen wrote in her
                        Journal: 'The second most eventful day of my life as regards feelings. I
                        felt as though I was being married over again myself, only much more
                        nervous'" (54). Perhaps biography must commit such solecisms of scale and
                        perspective. The subject's life necessarily comes to the fore; the births of
                        children or the emotions when these children are wed inevitably claim
                        importance, even if the subject should also care about a war, a massacre and
                        its genocidal revenge. It is neither the Queen's nor Carey's job to tell the
                        complete public story.</p>
                    <p>Carey's narrative raises more than one glaring mystery in spite of its polite
                        veneer. Why did Prince Albert fail? The explanation, that he was strained by
                        overwork, "the sense of his responsibility as private adviser to Her
                        Majesty," and the "'pressure which constantly compelled him to do in one day
                        what would have been more than ample work for two'" (unidentified source;
                        55-56), leaves doctors at the time convinced that typhoid fever, contracted
                        in a visit to a military academy in torrential rain, caused the illness. But
                        "he had no strong yearning for life.... Not long before his fatal illness,
                        in speaking to the Queen, he said: 'I do not cling to life; you do, but I
                        set no store by it'" (56). Could he have wished, like many a literary if not
                        actual wife, to fade from a condition of emotional strain, living up to
                        being the parent/spouse/advisor/friend of an imperial sovereign? Carey
                        synthesizes the many famous accounts of Prince Albert's illness by Victoria,
                        Princess Alice, and other witnesses. The chapter concludes with a verse by
                        "our glorious Poet Laureate" and these words: "'Their works do follow them.'
                        Truly we may say of our Great Prince that his beloved name is graven
                        indelibly on the hearts and memories of <milestone unit="subject"

                        men and English women" (59). </p>
                    <p>The final chapter, "Widowhood," "A Royal Mourner," with yet another
                        occasional verse by Tennyson, begins with an exceptional self-reference by
                        the narrator. "The writer of this sketch well remembers that melancholy
                        Sunday, December 15th, when the omission of the Prince Consort's name from
                        the Litany informed the congregation that their revered monarch was a widow.
                        A thrill ran through the church" (62). The congregation's mingled prayers
                        give way to the narrative of the queen's illness and grief, and the scene of
                        the funeral. The loss was collective: "Throughout the country there was long
                        and genuine mourning for the 'blameless Prince.' 'There is no one to call me
                        Victoria now,' the Queen is said to have exclaimed, the morning of her
                        bereavement,—and perhaps no words could have expressed more strongly the
                        sense of her great loneliness" (63). Carey quotes letters and poems about
                        the episode and Victoria's continuing period of mourning. "'For some years
                        after the death of the Prince Consort,' as Dr. Macaulay tells us, 'the Queen
                        appeared very little in public'" although "'no official duty as neglected.'
                        Neither did she forget the troubles of others; for when that terrible
                        Hartley colliery disaster occurred, by which 204 miners lost their lives,
                        Her Majesty sent a message to the effect 'that her tenderest sympathy is
                        with the poor widows and mothers, and that her own misery only makes her
                        feel the more for them'" (65). In response to complaints, Victoria had a
                        letter sent to the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> to the effect that she will
                        submit to public appearances that clearly serve "'the good of her people,'"
                        but that "there are other and higher duties than those of mere
                        representation which are now thrown on the Queen alone and unassisted,'"
                        work that has worn her down, at the risk of making her incapable of
                        fulfilling fundamental responsibilities. The people will not demand that she
                        appear at every ceremony. </p>
                    <p>And yet much of the remaining narrative is a series of ceremonies, some
                        family weddings, some visits to hospitals, and some consecrations of statues
                        or memorials to Albert. Meanwhile, the Queen "Queen showed her deep
                        solicitude for her subjects by causing a letter to be written to the various
                        directors of the railway companies, calling their attention to the
                        increasing number of serious accidents" (68), and instituted the Albert
                        Medal for those who saved, or endeavoured to save, the lives of others from
                        shipwreck or other perils of the sea" (69). She opened waterworks in
                        Aberdeen and "laid the first stone" of what became the Royal Albert Hall and
                        for St. Thomas's Hospital, as well as attending the opening of a bridge over
                        the Thames and new buildings for the University of London (69-70). The
                        staging of ceremonial appearances plays an increasing role in Carey's
                        narrative, in keeping with the technological and institutional expansion of
                        the age. The pages of this chapter begin to resemble a log or list, often in
                        paragraphs of a single sentence. Children and grandchildren are married,
                        fall ill, recover, or die; buidings are opened or memorials dedicated. Then,
                        Carey shifts tactics, condensing good deeds and years in one paragraph,
                        quoted in part here: "There were numerous other good works inaugurated by
                        the Queen during the next few years: the laying of the foundation stone of
                        the new Medical Examination Hall of the Royal College of Physicians and
                        Surgeons on the Thames Embankment; the opening of the Colonial and Indian
                        Exhibition at South Kensington, the Liverpool Exhibition, and the Royal
                        Holloway College for Women at Mount Lee, Egham; and also of the People's
                        Palace at the East End, in the May preceding Jubilee Day. There have been
                        three royal jubilees in the history of England, but none of them can compare
                        with the Jubilee of June 21st, 1887, unless it be the Jubilee of 1897, when
                        our beloved Sovereign commemorated the sixtieth year of her reign. It was a
                        sight that thrilled all hearts when the Queen left her palace gates that
                        June morning, surrounded by her glorious guard of honour, sons, sons-in-law
                        and grandsons, on her way to Westminster Abbey. The fair young Queen of
                        fifty years before was now a grey-haired woman, but the loving heart still
                        responded to her faithful subjects' acclamations" (74). </p>
                    <p>Here Carey returns to her earlier method of splicing together other
                        biographical sources, as she winds up the account of the elderly Queen's
                        life. "There can be little doubt, as Barnett Smith tells us, that 'Her
                        Majesty has outlived all her early friends and faithful servants. All who
                        officiated at her coronation have passed into the land of shadows. If she
                        has tasted all the happiness of life, she has tasted likewise its
                        bitterness, for death has ever been busy laying his finger here and there
                        upon her beloved friends, relatives and associates. . . . The Queen's reign
                        is coincident with the most surprising progress at home and abroad. It has
                        been the age of railways, of trans-oceanic steamers and of the telegraph, of
                        free trade, parliamentary reform, and the abolition of the corn laws'" (75).
                        Her "firm serene rule, keen intellect, and wide sympathies" have guided an
                        age of enlightened progress and imperial expansion. </p>
                    <p>Carey repeatedly emphasizes the image of Victoria as elderly and frail. For
                        the sake of fresh air, she sets up an outdoor office. The book "The Private
                        Life of the Queen" is quoted as before: "'At Windsor the little Frogmore
                        tea-house, with its lovely surroundings, is the chosen spot; and here,
                        beneath the shade of two magnificent evergreen oaks, the Queen's
                        writing-table and despatch-boxes are set out on fine mornings, while two
                        mounted messengers keep up perpetual communication with the telegraph office
                        and telephones at the Castle; and the attendant secretary stands at her
                        side. ... In addition to the public work, the self-imposed private work done
                        by Her Majesty is extraordinary'" (76). Unsurpassable as correspondent, the
                        Queen makes her presence felt in letters of sympathy to the survivors of any
                        disaster. Further, she studies Hindustani and "the Empress of India writes
                        her diary in that language. It has been said, 'that if the Queen had been
                        destined to write in lieu of ruling, she must have left a great mark on the
                        literature of the country'" (76). Carey, perhaps less certain of power of
                        writing unless supported by many excerpts from others' texts, concludes
                        characteristically with a poem that is also a prayer. </p>

                    </head>
                    <p>Preceding her canonization in <dateRange from="1920-01-01" to="1920-12-31"
                            >1920</dateRange>, the Victorian era experienced a revived interest in
                        the historical figure <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc</name>.
                        Because the biographical accounts written at the time reflect the various
                        ideologies of the age, one doesn’t know what to expect of her portrayal. Was
                        she illustrated as a divinely inspired prophetess or simply an imaginative
                        heroine? Universally, they regale her with flowery prose, depicting her as
                        an archetypal tragic heroine who is wronged by her contemporaries; however,
                        it seems that Victorian authors are unable to agree on the extent of her
                        holiness. Her secular self takes a back seat with her “divinity” pushed
                        beneath the spotlight in some instances, and in others the case is reversed.
                        Also, some authors comment on her adopting male conduct, wearing men’s
                        attire, and leading the men of the French military. Many authors state
                        outright what they feel to be appropriate behavior of a member of the
                        “fairer sex,” while others neglect the issue entirely. These discordant
                        viewpoints concerning <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc’s</name>
                        divinity and adherence to gender roles are reflective of the controversial
                        social issues prominent during the Victorian era.</p>
                    <p><name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc</name> was born in the <rs
                            type="place" key="country">French</rs> village <rs type="place"
                            key="village">Domrémy</rs> to <name type="father">Jacques d’Arc</name>
                        and <name type="mother">Isabelle Romée</name> in <dateRange
                            from="1412-01-01" to="1412-12-31">1412</dateRange>. Although sources
                        generally portray her childhood as a happy one, the context of <name
                            corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan’s</name> upbringing was both chaotic and
                        violent. The <rs type="place" key="country">French</rs> and the <rs
                            type="place" key="country">English</rs> were entangled in the Hundred
                        Years’ War, an international conflict that would ultimately determine the
                        future king of <rs type="place" key="country">France</rs>. After 341 years
                        of rule, the royal family line of the Capetians ended in <dateRange
                            from="1328-01-01" to="1328-12-31">1328</dateRange> leaving the <rs
                            type="place" key="country">French</rs> throne unoccupied. In a desperate
                        attempt to assume the throne amidst the controversy concerning the
                        establishment of a legitimate heir, the <rs type="place" key="country"
                            >French</rs> and the <rs type="place" key="country">English</rs> entered
                        a war that would last for over a century. <name>Charles VI</name>, during
                        one of his bouts of insanity, had signed the Treaty of <rs type="place"
                            key="city">Troyes</rs> which ensured <rs type="place">English</rs> claim
                        to the <rs type="place" key="country">French</rs> throne. <name>Charles
                            VII</name>, the Dauphin, came to be seen as an illegitimate heir, while
                        the infant <name>Henry VI</name> became the King of <rs type="place"
                            key="country">France</rs> in <dateRange from="1422-01-01"
                            to="1422-12-31">1422</dateRange>. Those still loyal to <name>Charles
                            VII</name>, however, would continue their hostile resistance against <rs
                            type="place" key="country">English</rs> occupation.</p>
                    <p><name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc</name> claimed to have experienced
                        visions from the time she was twelve, one of which included images of
                            <name>Saint Michael</name>, <name>Saint Catherine</name> and <name>Saint
                            Margaret</name> instructing her to rid <rs type="place" key="country"
                            >France</rs> of the <rs type="place" key="country">English</rs> and
                        restore the Dauphin to the throne. The means by which Victorian authors
                        attempt to explain this phenomenon are far from unanimous. For example,
                        while biographer <name>Lord Ronald Gower</name> continuously refers to
                            <name>Joan’s</name> “presences” as visions, <name>John Maskelyne</name>
                        refers to them as mere “hallucinations” and “illusions,”
                            (<name>Maskelyne</name>, 235). Biographer <name>William Adams</name> is
                        caught in the same dilemma, portraying the young <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC"
                            >Joan</name> as an impressionable child who was simultaneously directed
                        by God (<name>Adams</name>, 245-247).</p>
                    <p>In response to her visions, at sixteen years of age <name
                            corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan</name> requested that she be brought to
                            <name>Count Robert de Baudricourt</name> so that she might earn
                        permission to visit <name>Charles VII</name> at the royal court of <rs
                            type="place" key="city">Chinon</rs>. (She would have to be escorted
                        across enemy territory for the encounter with the Dauphin to take place). On
                        her second attempt she won the Count’s approval, as she managed to
                        accurately predict the result of the Battle of the Herrings.</p>
                    <p>News of <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan’s</name> visit spread quickly;
                        therefore, to test her divinity <name>Charles</name> dressed himself in
                        commoner’s clothing and adorned another in rich garb to mislead her. When
                        she arrived at court, however, she knelt before <name>Charles</name> instead
                        of the decoy, and despite <name>Charles'</name> denials, declared him the
                        true Dauphin: “‘In God’s name it is not they, but you, who are the King.
                        Most noble Dauphin, I am <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Jeanne</name> the Maid.
                        The Heavenly King sends me to help you and the realm; and to tell you that
                        you shall be anointed and crowned in the city of <rs type="place" key="city"
                            >Rheims</rs>, and that you shall reign as lieutenant of the Heavenly
                        King, who is the King of <rs type="place" key="country">France</rs>’”
                            (<name>Adams</name>, 250). Pulling him aside for a private
                        discussion—although there is no record of what was actually exchanged—she
                        managed to convince him to allow her to lead his army against the <rs
                            type="place" key="country">English</rs>.</p>
                    <p>After having been granted permission to assist in the command of the <rs
                            type="place" key="country">French</rs> army, <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC"
                            >Joan</name> deviated from traditional <rs type="place" key="country"
                            >French</rs> tactics of war and managed a series of victories against
                        the <rs type="place" key="country">English</rs>, acquiring the fortress of
                            <rs type="place" key="city">Saint Loup</rs> on <date>May 4, 1429</date>,
                        the fortress of <rs type="place" key="city">Saint Jean le Blanc</rs> on
                            <date>May 5</date>, the fortress of <rs type="place" key="city">Saint
                            Augustins</rs> on <date>May 6</date>, and on <date>May 7</date> the <rs
                            type="place" key="city">Orleans</rs> stronghold les Tourelles (an
                        achievement that left her with a wounded neck). She had another string of
                        victories in the month following, reclaiming <rs type="place" key="city"
                            >Jargeau</rs> on <date>June 12</date>, <rs type="place" key="city"
                            >Meung-sur-Loire</rs> on <date>June 15</date>, and <rs type="place"
                            key="city">Beaugency</rs> on <date>June 17</date>. She also had success
                        in the <date>June 18</date> Battle of <rs type="place" key="city"
                        >Patay</rs>, which would be the turning point of the Hundred Years’ War,
                        granting <rs type="place" key="country">France</rs> the lead against <rs
                            type="place" key="country">England</rs>. As a result of her success in
                        battle, she was able to accomplish one of the primary aims of her mission:
                        the coronation of <name>Charles VII</name> in <rs type="place" key="city"
                            >Rheims</rs> on <date>July 17</date>.</p>
                    <p>Throughout sieges, captures, and even <name>King Charles’</name> coronation,
                            <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan</name> wore the attire of a male
                        knight. Although the <rs type="place" key="country">French</rs> had
                        tolerated <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan’s</name> style of dress in her
                        campaigns, it seems that Victorian authors were unable to agree on whether
                        her transvestitism—and in a few cases her military leadership—was
                        appropriate. After having described the coronation at <rs type="place"
                            key="city">Rheims</rs>, one particular author remarks: "as the grand
                        object of her mission was now, by the will of Heaven, accomplished, she
                        entreated his permission to return home, and resume those occupations and
                        that course of life which became her sex” (<name>James</name>, 34-35). Like
                        other biographers, although he issues abundant praise for <name
                            corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan’s</name> service to her country, he still
                        adheres to Victorian ideology concerning the distinction between gender
                        roles. Another example is <name>Gower’s</name> reconstruction of <name
                            corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan’s</name> character during her trial,
                        reaffirming the Victorian perception of women as members of the fairer and
                        weaker sex: “Even <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc’s</name> courage
                        failed at that sight, and all the woman in her nature asserted itself”
                            (<name>Gower</name>, 232). <name>Gower</name> also notes that she “had
                        not the defect of so many excellent but tedious women, who love talk for the
                        mere sake of talking” (6). Other biographical accounts convey the opposite,
                        disregarding expectations of women and depicting her solely as a beacon of
                        unconquerable strength (<name>Adams</name>, 253).</p>
                    <p><name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan</name> was one of the last to leave the
                        battlefield of <rs type="place" key="city">Compiègne</rs>, resulting in her
                        imminent capture on <date>May 23rd, 1430</date>. She had led a successful
                        attack against the <rs type="place" key="country">Burgundians</rs> until the
                            <rs type="place" key="country">English</rs> intervened and attacked the
                        rear guard. Apparently, she would have made it to safety had not the
                        drawbridge to the heavily fortified town of <rs type="place" key="city"
                            >Compiègne</rs> been raised at the very last minute. She and a few of
                        her closest aides stranded outside with her were promptly taken as prisoners
                        to <rs type="place" key="city">Margny</rs>, the <rs type="place"
                            key="country">Burgundian</rs> camp. Strangely, according to
                            <name>Gower</name>, <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan</name> had at
                        certain instances demonstrated that she might have known about her fate
                        beforehand:</p>
                    <p>‘My children and dear friends, I bid you to mark that I have been sold and
                        betrayed and that I shall be shortly put to death. So I beseech you all to
                        pray to God for me, for never more shall I be able to be of service to the
                        King or to the Kingdom of <rs type="place" key="country">France</rs>’
                            (<name>Gower</name>, 126).</p>
                    <p>This appears to be another confirmation of her divinely inspired nature, as
                        portrayed by select Victorian biographers. <name>Gower</name> also makes a
                        curious statement that reflects the tendency to expound upon the “essence”
                        of the biographical subject: “This story, whether authentic or not, is
                        surely a touching one, is full of the spirit of the heroine,”
                            (<name>Gower</name>, 126). Authenticity is not as important a factor as
                        “the spirit of the heroine,” quite clearly. Any detail, as long as it
                        eulogizes the subject in some way, is worthy of documentation.</p>
                    <p>The trial, which took place in <rs type="place" key="city">Rouen</rs> from
                            <date>March 26</date> to <date>May 24, 1431</date>, was conducted by
                            <name>Pierre Cauchon</name>, Bishop of <rs type="place" key="city"
                            >Beauvais</rs> and was preceded by an interrogation lasting over fifteen
                        sessions. During interrogation, <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan</name> was
                        rigorously questioned about her birth, her religious upbringing, her
                        visions, her manly garb, her military actions and even her virginity.
                        Throughout the trial, <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan</name> famously
                        refused to swear an oath concerning the truthfulness of her answers to the
                        judges: “You may ask me questions on which I shall be able to answer you,
                        and others about which I cannot” (<name>Gower</name>, 158). After
                        interrogation <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc</name> was forced to
                        endure torture locked in an iron cage for fifty days and nights.
                        Nevertheless, she retained a great deal of dignity and mental clarity,
                        speaking shrewdly and firmly in her defense. Her courage is certainly
                        exalted in Victorian biography; for every factual detail there is a comment
                        on her virtue and bravery. In one instance, <name>Gower</name> exclaims,
                        “Glorious words, worthy of her who spoke them! They bear with them a heroic
                        ring, and reveal with one sublime expression the very soul and spirit of
                            <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc</name>!” (192). Rousing,
                        majestic expressions like “sublime” and “heroic” add to the already
                        larger-than-life qualities attributed to her. Her noble character is
                        contrasted with those of her captors, who are depicted as dastardly and
                        devoid of morals: “No doubt can be entertained that she was a sacrifice to
                        jealousy, in the first place, leaving hypocrisy and cruelty to do their part
                        in the course of her trial--that mockery of justice and everlasting disgrace
                        to all who bore a part in it” (<name>James</name>, 43). This line
                        illustrates the sharp polarization of good and evil in these Victorian
                        accounts. The sweeping descriptions “sacrifice to jealousy” and “everlasting
                        shame and infamy” have a sense of permanence that coincides with the
                        prevalent religious overtone. There seems to be a clear delineation between
                        the holy and the blasphemous.</p>
                    <p>The conclusion to the dramatic trial was her iconic, romanticized execution.
                            <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of Arc</name> was condemned to burn at
                        the stake on <date>May 30, 1431</date>, only six days after the trial ended.
                        She was bullied into signing an abjuration stating that she would either
                        wear women’s clothes or immediately burn at the stake. She was sexually
                        assaulted only days after the abjuration and the perpetrators stole her
                        clothes and left her with nothing to cover herself but men’s attire. When
                        the Bishop noticed her garb, he immediately called for a meeting at the
                        archiepiscopal chapel on the <date>29th of May</date> in which all condemned
                        her to death.</p>
                    <p>She died beautifully, firmly clutching a crude cross made of staves as the
                        flames consumed her. Of course, Victorian biographers capitalized on the
                        dramatic nature of her death, by exaggerating her heroic and Christ-like
                        characteristics: “The crime of her martyrdom will ever rest, and surely no
                        other crime but one in the world’s history can be paralleled with it”
                            (<name>Gower</name>, 252). Yet not all of them are overwhelmed by
                        religious overtones. Biographer <name>George James</name>, for example, is a
                        lot more secular in his approach: “In an enlightened age, her transcendently
                        noble qualities, which were displayed in the best of causes, the just
                        defence of her king and country, would have secured her universal admiration
                        and gratitude; nor perhaps, can ancient or modern history furnish an example
                        of such pure and exalted heroism” (<name>James</name>, 62). This text in
                        particular focuses on her personal bravery and attitude rather than her
                        divinity. Also, the author takes the opportunity to opine on the superiority
                        of his own enlightened era, and does not refer to any form of spirituality.
                        The biographies’ dissonant portrayals of <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC"
                            >Joan</name> as either a heroic or divine figure (and in some instances
                        a blend of the two) echo the conflict between faith and secularism prominent
                        in Victorian society.</p>
                    <p>From the differing depictions and viewpoints of these biographies, one can
                        easily observe the extent to which Victorians diverged from one another in
                        social ethics and belief systems. <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan of
                            Arc</name>, a focused straightforward character, is poked and prodded in
                        multiple directions by these authors. To some she is a true messenger of
                        God, and to others she is merely a brave soul with an excitable imagination.
                        Their biographies hold up a looking glass to an age when people simply could
                        not decide whether to be spiritual or enlightened, whether to enforce gender
                        roles or to blur the lines. However, these accounts undividedly devote
                        themselves to eulogizing <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC">Joan</name> and making
                        it abundantly clear that her nature and deeds were to be venerated by
                        all.</p>

                        predilection for science, mathematics, and inventing, and he “preferred
                        inventing gadgets to saving souls” (<name>Neville-Sington</name>, <rs

                        incapacity for idleness, an inclination for math and mending, and a certain
                        rashness. While other girls were busy sewing, <name

                        pleasant persona, made her a delight in society, among friends, and to her

                            (<name>Trollope</name>, 42). Unfortunately, farming did not agree with

                        agricultural expertise, along with the unexpected denial of his uncle’s

                    <p><name corresp="FRANCES_TROLLOPE">Fanny</name> maintained her Victorian
                        stoicism in her lack of outward reaction to their dire circumstances. In her

                            <name>Thomas's</name> temper and virtually no mention of the
                            <name>Trollopes'</name> financial problems. <name
                            corresp="FRANCES_TROLLOPE">Fanny</name> only revealed her feelings and
                        family life in her later novels, in which she devised stories of strained
                        husband-wife and husband-son relationships with the knowledge of someone who
                        had personally experienced such tension and sorrow. Her novel <hi

                        also proved she could think independently from her husband, and relied upon
                        her female friends as her husband became more of a distant stranger. The

                    <p><name>Fanny</name> came to view <rs type="place" key="country">America</rs>
                        as an opportunity to mend multiple issues: in <rs type="place" key="country"

                        suggests that the minimal inheritance “indicated that her father had not

                    <p>During the <dateRange from="1860-01-01" to="1869-12-31">1860s</dateRange>,

                        like purity and tenderness. This might appear to be a contradiction today,

                        her breed of feminism was somewhat old-fashioned. Even though her writing

                        custody. At the time, a husband convicted of assault was punished, but no
                        one thought about the position of the abused wife. Many see this article as

                    <p><name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary Somerville</name> was an outstanding
                        mathematician and scientist of the Victorian period. Her scientific
                        contributions were doubly significant: not only was she a woman working
                        within a predominantly male domain, but modern science itself was a
                        fledgling field struggling to claim a place in Victorian culture. <name
                            corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary Somerville’s</name> enlightened work
                        helped to establish science as a distinct area of study in <rs type="place"
                            key="kingdom">Britain</rs>, and by the time of her death she was
                        well-known throughout <rs type="place" key="continent">Europe</rs> for both
                        her prodigious mathematical talents and her modest, polite, zealously
                        self-motivated personality. Curiously, <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE"
                            >Mary</name> was not a proficient reader until her early teens, and
                        encountered her first algebraic problem only by chance. Despite the many
                        objections from those attempting to deter her, and entirely through her own
                        efforts and determination, she became an internationally renowned authority
                        on emerging sciences, including physics and geography. </p>
                    <p><name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary Fairfax</name> was born on
                            <date>December 26, 1780</date>, not in her own home, but in that of her
                        mother’s sister. Her father was a vice-admiral in the <rs type="place"
                            key="kingdom">British</rs> Navy, sent to sea as a midshipman at scarcely
                        ten years of age. As he was so often absent, <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE"
                            >Mary’s</name> mother had decided to accompany him to his port of
                        departure in <rs type="place" key="city">London</rs>. In the throes of her
                        confinement, <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary’s</name> mother arrived at
                        her sister’s house in <rs type="place" key="town">Jedburgh</rs>, <rs
                            type="place" key="country">Scotland</rs> just in time to give birth to
                            <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name>. As <name
                            corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary’s</name> mother was ill following her
                        delivery, she was nursed by her aunt <name>Martha</name>, who also happened
                        to be the mother of her future husband (<name>Neeley</name> 23).</p>
                    <p><name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> grew up in <rs type="place"
                            key="kingdom">Fife</rs>, <rs type="place" key="country">Scotland</rs>,
                        in the “quiet, quaint little seaport village” (<name>Osen</name> 96) of <rs
                            type="place" key="town">Burntisland</rs>. The <name>Fairfax</name> house
                        and garden were close to the seashore, and <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE"
                            >Mary</name> spent much of her youth roaming the hillsides and coast
                        near her home, practically ignorant of the existence of mathematics. She
                        wrote in her autobiography: “I never cared for dolls, and had no one to play
                        with me” (<name>Somerville</name> 18), and her solitary wanderings
                        cultivated her profound fascination with nature. This lifelong love of
                        nature was fueled by her devout faith in God, as her mother, according to
                            <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary’s</name> own account, “taught me to
                        read the Bible, and to say my prayers morning and evening; otherwise she
                        allowed me to grow up a wild creature” (<name>Somerville</name> 17). Her
                        father, upon returning home from one of his long voyages, was dismayed to
                        find her such a “savage,” hardly able to read or write at ten years of age,
                        and he immediately sent her to a fashionable boarding school in <rs
                            type="place" key="town">Musselburgh</rs> (<name>Osen</name> 97), though
                            <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> was “utterly wretched” there
                            (<name>Somerville</name> 21) and only remained for one year.</p>
                    <p>After her brief sojourn in formal education, <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE"
                            >Mary</name> returned home to <rs type="place" key="town"
                            >Burntisland</rs> and assumed control over her own education. She
                        studied Latin, arithmetic, and writing, with only the aid of her own
                        resourcefulness. In her mid-teens, the disapproval of her
                        traditionally-minded family supplanted <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE"
                            >Mary’s</name> ever-increasing appetite for education, and she was
                        forced to spend more of her time learning domestic arts. She became quite
                        proficient in playing piano, drawing, and needlework, and had an active
                        social life. It was at a tea party that she encountered her very first
                        algebra problem. <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> and a friend
                        were flipping through a fashion magazine when she spotted some algebraic
                        symbols that kindled her interest, and she resolved to investigate the
                        subject further (<name>Osen</name> 99 – 100). Although unassertive by
                        nature, <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> eventually managed to
                        obtain and study a copy of <name>Euclid’s</name> Elements of Geometry
                        despite familial reproach. Indeed, “her mother was appalled and shamed by
                        such aberrant behavior, and the servants were instructed to confiscate <name
                            corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary’s</name> supply of candles so that she
                        could not study at night” (<name>Osen</name> 102).</p>
                    <p>In <dateRange from="1804-01-01" to="1804-12-31">1804</dateRange>, <name
                            corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> married her cousin <name>Samuel
                            Greig</name>, a captain in the <rs type="place" key="country"
                            >Russian</rs> Navy. Though he had already served with distinction, <name
                            corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary’s</name> parents would not hear of her
                        moving to <rs type="place" key="country">Russia</rs>, so <name>Samuel</name>
                        left active service and became the <rs type="place" key="country"
                            >Russian</rs> consol for <rs type="place" key="kingdom">Britain</rs> in
                            <rs type="place" key="city">London</rs> (<name>Patterson</name> 3).
                        Finally removed from the intellectual confines of her conservative family’s
                        criticism, <name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary</name> was less inhibited in
                        her mathematical studies, though not by much. In the words of her daughter
                            <name>Martha</name>, “nothing can be more erroneous than the statement…
                        that <name>Mr. Greig</name> (<name corresp="MARY_SOMERVILLE">Mary's</name>
                        first husband) aided her in her mathematical and other pursuits. Nearly the
                        contrary was the case. <name>Mr. Greig</name> took no interest in science or
                        literature, and possessed in full the prejudice against learned women which
                        was common at that time” (<name>Somerville</name> 3). Of the two children
                        she had with <name>Samuel</name>, one died at the age of seven and the

                        astronomy and natural science. She continued to advance her scientific
                        knowledge, slowly acquiring a small library as well as professional advice.

                        stated that “I simply translated <name>Laplace’s</name> work from algebra

                            Procter</name> wrote a letter describing a peasant’s engagement party
                        she had attended in <rs type="place" key="country">Italy</rs>:</p>
                    <p>"We have been to a ball, of which I must give you a description. Last
                        Tuesday… we heard very distinctly a band of music, which rather excited my
                        astonishment… <name>Emily</name> said, ‘Oh! That band is playing at the
                        farmer’s near here. The daughter is fiancée to-day, and they have a ball.’ I
                        said, ‘I wish I was going!’ ‘Well,’ replied she, ‘the farmer’s wife did call
                        to invite us.’ ‘Then, I shall certainly go,’ I exclaimed… We were received
                        with great enthusiasm; the only drawback being, that no one spoke French… I
                        began to be afraid that some idea of our dignity might prevent my getting a
                        partner; so, by <name>Madame B.’s</name> advice, I went up to the bride, and
                        offered to dance with her… My [other] partner was a little man, like
                            <name>Perrot</name>, and very proud of his dancing. He cut in the air
                        and twisted about, until I was out of breath, though my attempts to imitate
                        him were feeble in the extreme… after seven or eight dances, I was obliged
                        to sit down. We stayed till nine, and I was so dead beat with the heat that
                        I could hardly crawl about the house… it is so long since I have danced.”

                        this anecdote conflicts with the general impression of a severe or
                        meditative character, reflected in her role as a poet, advocate for women’s
                        rights, and member of a prominent literary family. A friend of the family
                        described the young <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter</name> as
                        possessing a “doomed” look about her, manifested in a “marked brow over

                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> character as he writes that
                        even on her deathbed “her old cheerfulness never quitted her”
                            (<name>Dickens</name>, xxiii). Though <name>Dickens</name> proved to be
                        a prominent advocate for <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter</name> and
                        her works, one must wonder what he saw in the young lady that few others
                        did. These markedly different perceptions of <name
                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Adelaide Anne Procter’s</name> personality
                        only begin to relate all the ways she was, and is today, perceived by
                        critics and friends alike. </p>
                    <p><name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Adelaide</name> was born into the
                            <name>Procter</name> family in <rs type="place" key="city">London</rs>
                        on <date>October 30, 1825</date>, and she “grew up amid surroundings
                        calculated to develop her literary taste” (<name>Lee</name>, 1). Many family
                        friends perceived that she had a serious demeanor, as they would have
                        expected of the daughter of a well-respected poet. Her father, <name>Bryan
                            Waller Procter</name>, who published under the name <name>Barry
                            Cornwall</name>, was a lawyer and a poet so well regarded that he has
                        prominent placement in several short obituaries of his daughter. <name
                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> mother encouraged her
                        daughter’s interest in poetry by copying poems into a small album, which the
                        young girl carried “about like another little girl might have carried a
                        doll” (<name>Dickens</name>, xvi). <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER"
                            >Procter</name> grew up surrounded by important figures of literature
                        and reform, such as <name>William Makepeace Thackery</name>, <name>Charles
                            Dickens</name>, <name>Thomas Carlyle</name>, and <name>M. P. Benjamin
                            Leigh Smith</name> (<name>Hoeckley</name>, 2); however, as her
                        experience at the engagement party documents, she also enjoyed associating
                        with people outside her elite circle, and took pleasure in non-literary
                        pursuits.</p>
                    <p>Despite <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> familiarity with
                        the literary world, she refused to rely on her connections as she sought
                        publication. She even submitted her poetry to <name>Dickens’</name>
                        publication, Household Words, under the pseudonym “<name>Miss
                        Berwick</name>” (2). Her use of a female name (unlike authors such as
                            <name>Marian Evans</name> and the <name corresp="CHARLOTTE_Brontë"
                            >Brontë</name> sisters who used masculine pen names) can be seen as an
                        early indication of her later campaigns for women’s rights, becaue she
                        promoted women’s entrance into the male-dominated sphere of publication.
                            <name>Dickens</name> himself was unaware that <name>Miss Berwick</name>,
                        whose poetry he frequently published, was actually <name
                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Adelaide Anne Procter</name>, the daughter of
                        a long-time family friend. One winter day in <dateRange from="1854-01-01"
                            to="1854-12-31">1854</dateRange>, as he visited with the
                            <name>Procter</name> family, he warmly praised the unknown female poet
                        whose work he had been publishing for two years (2). The following evening,
                        he learned that he had been praising “<name>Miss Berwick</name>” in her
                        presence (2). Until then, <name>Dickens</name> and the Household Words staff
                        had fantasized that this mysterious <name>Miss Berwick</name> was a
                        governess. He had so fully invented her character that his “mother was not a
                        more real personage to [him], than <name>Miss Berwick</name> the governess
                        became” (<name>Dickens</name>, xiv), but he transferred his admiration for
                            “<name>Miss Berwick</name>” to <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Miss
                            Procter</name>. Her use of a pseudonym “strikingly illustrates the
                        honesty, independence, and quiet dignity, of the lady’s character” (xiv-xv)
                        because she relied on her talent, rather than her connections, to advance
                        her art.</p>
                    <p><name>Dickens’</name> appreciation for <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER"
                            >Procter’s</name> poetry continued after he discovered her identity, and
                        over time she became his most published author (<name>Gregory</name>, <name
                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">A. Procter</name>, 1). <name>Dickens</name>
                        published her poetry not only in Household Words, but also All the Year
                        Round, another of his well-circulated periodicals (<name>Hoeckley</name>, 2;
                            <name>Lee</name>, 1). Although very few periodicals besides
                            <name>Dickens’</name> featured her work (<name>Drain</name>, 2), she had
                        ample opportunity to publish her poetry through <name>Dickens</name>. She
                        was the only poet whom he featured in his Christmas edition.
                            (<name>Gregory</name>, LW, 228). She published her own two-volume book
                        of poetry, Legends and Lyrics, in <dateRange from="1858-05-01"
                            to="1858-01-31">May of 1858</dateRange>, and both volumes were reprinted
                        in multiple editions. </p>
                    <p>Although <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter</name> found professional
                        success as an artist, her poetic ability is only one of many traits
                        distinguishing her from most Victorian women. She was raised as a
                        Protestant, but she and her sisters converted to Catholicism in <dateRange
                            from="1851-01-01" to="1851-12-31">1851</dateRange>, possibly influenced
                        by an Italian aunt (<name>Hoeckley</name>, 2). This conversion is
                        significant: given the strong anti-Catholic sentiments throughout <rs
                            type="place" key="country">England</rs> at this time, her conversion
                        shows strength of character. Some scholars speculate, however, that she had
                        already secretly adopted Catholicism two years earlier (<name>Drain</name>,
                        2), when she was twenty-four. <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER"
                            >Adelaide</name>may have waited to announce her decision until she had
                        her sisters’ support because her conversion complicated the initially strong
                        relationship between herself and her father (<name>Gregory</name>, LW, 10).
                        But whether she feared cultural or familial disapproval, her delay may
                        detract from her iconic position as an independent woman. However, her
                        Catholic faith led her directly to passionate involvement with social work,
                        arguably one of her most progressive achievements.</p>
                    <p>Because of widespread bigotry against Catholics, <name
                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> conversion aligned her with
                        oppressed sectors of society, including working-class <rs type="place"
                            key="country">Irish</rs> Catholics (11). She supported the Providence
                        Row Night Refuge, which aided predominantly Catholic homeless women and
                        children (11). Her concern for the disenfranchised also led her to the
                        struggle for women’s rights, a cause she championed throughout her life. She
                        associated with other women who combined their artistic and cultural
                        interests with the advancement of women’s causes. These women frequently met
                        in each other’s homes to discuss marriage and property laws in the context
                        of women’s lives (<name>Hoeckley</name>, 3). Though they often met sexist
                        criticism meant to trivialize their cause (3), that attention also indicated
                        that their ideas posed a threat to the societal status quo.</p>
                    <p><name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter</name> used her success as a poet to
                        advance the causes for which she fought. Beyond writing for personal
                        enjoyment, she also dedicated her literary efforts to helping women in the
                        workplace. She united her passions for writing and reform through her work
                        in The <rs type="place" key="country">English</rs> Woman’s Journal, which
                        fought for women’s equality in education, employment, and property rights
                        (3). She used her poetic skills to provide a voice for the Catholic widows
                        and orphans she was helping through the Providence Row Night Refuge. While
                        working to support the Society to Promote the Employment of Women (SPEW),
                        she published <title>
                            <hi rend="italics">Victoria Regia: a Volume of Original Contributions in
                                Poetry and Prose</hi>
                        </title> (3-4). This publication supported the cause of female employment by
                        using a printing company which exclusively employed women (4). <name
                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> poetic success was not only
                        a personal victory, but also a way for her to advance her belief in social
                        justice.</p>
                    <p>Despite her prolific publication, critical reception of her poetry was and
                        remains highly ambivalent. Even <name>Dickens</name>, <name
                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> most enthusiastic advocate,
                        was uneasy about the social aspects of her poetry. While declaring his
                        admiration for her style, he evinced some apprehension about those social
                        aspects (<name>Gregory</name>, LW, 197). He praised her philanthropic work
                        but avoided mentioning her official positions within liberal organizations
                        (197). Beyond her possibly controversial topics, a contemporary biographer
                        writes that her style of poetry was often “not only sentimental but also
                        formally simplistic” (<name>Hoeckley</name>, 5). <name>Procter</name>
                        herself admitted that “Papa is a poet. I only write verses”
                            (<name>Drain</name>, 3). Despite its formal uninventiveness, her poetry
                        was popular because of its “invariably simple and direct language and
                        strongly affective rhetoric. This simplicity… masks a complexity of thought
                        and feeling” (<name>Gregory</name>, LW, 3-4). Critiques of her work,
                        accompanied with <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> own
                        humility, suggest that her poetry’s significance comes from its content
                        rather than its form or style.</p>
                    <p><name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> relationships within
                        feminist societies have led to speculations about her sexuality. Little is
                        known about her romantic and sexual liaisons. She was engaged at least once,
                        according to a letter from <name>William Makepeace Thackeray</name>, and
                        there is additional evidence that she was engaged to a man who devastated
                        her by breaking the engagement (21, 24). This latter incident probably
                        occurred two years before the <name>Thackeray</name> letter, although the
                        dating and details are so uncertain that this may be the same man (21, 24).
                        Despite these documented heterosexual relationships, rumors of her
                        lesbianism have persisted. Her friendship with <name>Matilda M. Hays</name>,
                        a co-editor of The <rs type="place" key="country">English</rs> Woman’s
                        Journal, may not have been platonic: “She dedicated the ‘First Series’ of
                        Legends and Lyrics to ‘<name>Matilda M. Hays</name>’. On the <date>23
                            January 1858</date>
                        <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter</name> wrote a poem titled ‘To
                        M.M.H’…It is a poem which expresses love for <name>Hays</name>… who dressed
                        in men’s clothes and had lived with [a woman] in <rs type="place" key="city"
                            >Rome</rs>” (24-25). Other than the vaguely erotic nature of several of
                        her poems (254), there is little evidence about her romantic or sexual
                        life.</p>
                    <p>The intense activity and ceaseless work that made <name
                            corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter</name> remarkable contributed to her
                        early death at the age of thirty-eight. She was confined to her bed for the
                        last fifteen months of her short life as she suffered from tuberculosis. It
                        is highly possible that her work among the sick exposed her to the
                        tuberculosis that killed her, although her intense work ethic rendered her
                        physically ill-equipped to fight the disease (<name>Hoeckley</name>, 5). She
                        died in the presence of her mother and sister in <rs type="place" key="city"
                            >London</rs> at the age of thirty-eight (<name>Dickens</name>,
                        xxiv).</p>
                    <p>Despite her passionate activism, her obituaries hailed her importance as a
                        poet and as her father’s literary heir. Her obituary in The Examiner lists
                        her poetic achievements with no mention of her social importance (The
                        Examiner). It fallaciously states that she died unexpectedly, despite her
                        fifteen months on bed rest (The Examiner). Her obituary in <rs type="place"
                            key="city">Liverpool</rs> Mercury Etc. falsely reports that she died “at
                        about thirty years of age” (<rs type="place" key="city">Liverpool</rs>).
                        Both of these inconsistencies romanticize her premature death. In another
                        obituary, published by an <rs type="place" key="country">Irish</rs>
                        newspaper, <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER">Procter’s</name> Catholic faith
                        is celebrated above her achievements; the author claims that “The religious
                        no less than the literary world has good cause to lament [her] loss”
                        (Freeman’s). These early accounts of her life omit her social reform, while
                        contemporary biographers emphasize her importance as a woman’s advocate
                        above her merit as a poet. As society has recognized the importance of
                        women’s rights, this aspect of <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER"
                            >Procter’s</name> life has been more celebrated. These different
                        perceptions are possible because <name corresp="ADELAIDE_PROCTER"
                            >Procter</name> was such a rich character, with a young woman’s

                    </head>
                    <p>At the dawn of the Victorian Era, one diminutive but brave young woman
                        captivated the national consciousness as a result of her role in a dangerous
                        rescue mission off the coast of <rs type="place" key="county"
                            >Northumberland</rs>. Her name was <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace
                            Darling</name>, and through her efforts in the rescue of nine
                        shipwrecked passengers early on the morning of <date>September 7,
                            1838</date>, she was transformed into an exalted national hero. She was
                        both lauded and hounded by the public up until her early death, after which
                        she, and her story, continued to entrance the public imagination in Britain
                        and abroad.</p>
                    <p><name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace Horsley Darling</name> was born in <rs
                            type="place" key="village"/>Bamburgh, <rs type="place" key="county"
                            >Northumberland</rs> on <date>November 14, 1815</date>, and was the
                        seventh of <name>William</name> and <name>Thomasin Darling’s</name> nine
                        children. <name>William Darling</name> was a lighthouse keeper, as his
                        father had been before him, and <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>
                        and her siblings grew up on the “Longstone Light on one of the wild and
                        savage <rs type="place" key="archipelago"/>Farne islands”
                            (<name>Sitwell</name> 59). Relatively little is known regarding <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name> early years, though she seems to
                        have received a solid education evident in her handwriting, which was “equal
                        to that of most ladies” (<name>Bruce</name> 376). Furthermore, she was
                        surrounded by books, albeit those “principally [of] Divinity” and
                        “Geography, History, Voyages and Travels, with Maps” (<name>Mitford</name>
                        89). Her father regarded novels and other forms of literature, as well as
                        pursuits such as card-playing, to be the works of the Devil, and raised his
                        family within the confines of strict Puritanism (<name>Mitford</name> 89;
                        ODNB ). </p>
                    <p>In their remote location, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and her
                        family were isolated from society at large, making only occasional
                        excursions to the mainland, and otherwise occupying themselves with the
                        daily domestic duties of the lighthouse (<name>Bruce</name>). Perhaps as a
                        result of this confined but (for <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>,
                        apparently) enjoyable upbringing, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>
                        was “remarkable for a retiring and somewhat reserved disposition”
                            (<name>Bruce</name> 376). She assisted her father in his work on the
                        lighthouse and kept watch at times (ODNB), bearing witness to several wrecks
                        and rescues over the course of her lifetime but never participating in them,
                        as her older brothers were always present to help their father
                            (<name>Bruce</name>). </p>
                    <p>In this manner, for the first twenty-two years of her life, the mild-tempered
                        “young girl of five feet two, with small wrists” (<name>Sitwell</name> 61)
                        lived quietly in a household of sober industry and religious commitment. The
                        events of the early hours of <name>September 7, 1838</name>, however,
                        drastically expanded the confined world in which <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> lived, though they never seemed to
                        change her fundamental personality and temperament.</p>
                    <p>The Forfarshire, one of the largest steamships of its day, set off from port
                        on <date>September 6, 1838</date>, carrying around sixty people, crew and
                        passengers. Upon encountering a brutal storm near the <rs type="place"
                            key="archipelago">Farne Islands</rs>, the ship was wrecked on Big Harcar
                        Rock (<name>Mitford</name> 29). <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>,
                        keeping watch from the lighthouse, glimpsed the nine survivors at around
                        five o’clock on the morning of <date>September 7</date> and informed her
                        father (<name>Thomasin Darling</name>). Her older brothers had all left
                        their parents by then to live on the mainland, while her younger brother,
                        who was usually present at the lighthouse, was away on a fishing excursion
                            (<name>Mitford</name> 29). As a result, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING"
                            >Grace</name> was put in the unusual position of being the only
                        able-bodied assistant for her father. Most initial accounts of the story of
                        this day portray <name>William Darling</name> as reluctant and unwilling to
                        brave the stormy waters, while <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>
                        forced him into action by declaring her intention to go regardless of his
                        participation (<name>Sitwell</name>). Later accounts, however, have
                        questioned this depiction of the story, and the only firsthand written
                        account of the rescue is that of <name>William Darling</name> himself, in
                        the official letter he wrote to the Secretary of Trinity House. </p>
                    <p>His depiction of the rescue is a straightforward factual representation in
                        which he credits his “Daughter” with having “observed a vessel on Harker’s
                        Rock” and “incessantly [applying] the glass until near 7 o’clock when, the
                        tide being fallen [they] observed three or four men upon the rock.” He then
                        states that they “agreed that if [they] could get to them some of them would
                        be able to assist [them] back,” after which they “immediately launched
                        [their] boat, and [were] enabled to gain the rock.” <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and <name>William</name> then
                        returned to the Lighthouse with the sole woman and four of the men, two of
                        whom then returned with <name>William</name> to retrieve the remaining four
                        men (<name>William Darling</name>). The matter-of-fact attitude with which
                        these events were treated by the <name>Darling</name> family is evident in
                            <name>William Darling’s</name> account of the rescue. To a family of
                        lighthouse-keepers, dangerous rescues were fairly frequent occurrences, and
                        the efforts that <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and her father
                        put forth were expected and unremarkable. Indeed, William Darling is likely
                        to have thought of the prospect of "sole salvage rights" to the goods in the
                        wreck if he could reach the ship (ODNB). The rest of the nation, however,
                        did not perceive the event in such a pragmatic manner. Instead, the public
                        exalted the romantic and heroic nature of the event in a manner directly
                        opposed to the down-to-earth humility of the <name>Darlings’</name>
                        reaction.</p>
                    <p>The year <dateRange from="1838-01-01" to="1838-12-31">1838</dateRange>, one
                        year following the beginning of <name corresp="QUEEN_VICTORIA">Queen
                            Victoria’s</name> reign and its corresponding era, was a “moment [that]
                        was opportune for acclaiming female virtue” (Correspondent). Although <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and her father played equally
                        significant roles in the rescue of the survivors, it was <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and the combination of her
                        unconventional physical feat and virtuous humility, emblematic of ideal
                        Victorian womanhood, that attracted the media and publicity. The number of
                        visitors at the Longstone Lighthouse increased exponentially as people from
                        all over the country flocked to meet the great heroine and see the location
                        of her selfless deed.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the masses that besieged the once reclusive world of Longstone
                        Lighthouse, numerous institutions celebrated the <name>Darling</name>
                        family. The Royal Humane Society acknowledged <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING"
                            >Grace</name> and <name>William Darling</name> in a special general
                        court held on <date>October 31, 1838</date> that highlighted the
                        “intrepidity, presence of mind, and humanity that nobly urged
                            [<name>Grace</name>]” to rescue the survivors of the shipwreck
                            (<name>Thomasin Darling</name> 26). In addition to this acknowledgment,
                            <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and <name>William</name> each
                        received the society’s Golden Medallion, one of the highest honors of that
                        time. The Duke of <rs type="place" key="county">Northumberland</rs> was
                        chosen to deliver the honorific medallions, and he added to the delivery his
                        own gifts for the family: waterproof clothing, a silver teapot, a gold seal
                        engraved with <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name> initials, and
                        four pounds of tea. It was through this act of largesse that the lifelong
                        friendship between the Duke and <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>
                        began (<name>Thomasin Darling</name>).</p>
                    <p>Following the Royal Humane Society’s lead, many other national and local
                        institutions recognized <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name>
                        actions. She received medals from The Royal Institution for the Preservation
                        of Life from Shipwreck, The <rs type="place" key="city">Edinburgh</rs> and
                            <rs type="place" key="district">Leith</rs> Humane Society, The <rs
                            type="place" key="city">Glasgow</rs> Humane Society, and The Shipwreck
                        Society of <rs type="place" key="city">Newcastle</rs>. Some organizations,
                        such as Lloyds, the insurance company, and The Ladies of <rs type="place"
                            key="city">Edinburgh</rs>, chose to send money and stocks to <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and her father. Just a year after
                        the shipwreck, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> had received about
                        seven hundred and fifty pounds' worth of stock (<name>Thomasin
                            Darling</name>). </p>
                    <p>Medals, stocks, and money were not the only gifts that <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and her family received. Admirers
                        sent a plethora of treasures that included silver tea sets, jewelry, and
                        even a beaver bonnet. The number of presents received by the family, despite
                        its immensity, was insignificant in comparison to the number of letters sent
                        to the lighthouse. Many people wrote simply to praise <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>, demonstrating the public
                        fascination surrounding her. Others wrote to describe how they had lost
                        loved ones in shipwrecks and to thank <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING"
                            >Grace</name> for preventing others from suffering the same loss. <name
                            corresp="QUEEN_VICTORIA">Queen Victoria</name> herself recognized and
                        contributed to <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name> national
                        prominence when the <name>Darlings</name> received a letter from the <rs
                            type="place" key="kingdom">United Kingdom’s</rs> Treasury stating that
                        “Her Majesty [had] been called to the circumstances attending the Wreck of
                        the Forfarshire Steamer” and wished to acknowledge <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace Darling</name> for her actions in saving
                        the survivors (<name>Thomasin Darling</name> 30). Amongst all of these
                        letters, however, there is no evidence that <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING"
                            >Grace</name> ever received acknowledgement from the survivors of the
                        Forfarshire’s wreck (<name>Thomasin Darling</name>).</p>
                    <p><name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> attempted to reply to every letter
                        and gift she received. She usually declined any admiration or gratitude,
                        insisting that she was simply God’s instrument, and that therefore it was
                        God who deserved the thanks. Many people wrote to <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> asking for a signature or lock of
                        her hair, leading her to begin enclosing locks of hair in her responses as a
                        means of repayment for the recognition she received (<name>Thomasin
                            Darling</name>). This custom soon ended, however, as <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> “would soon have been left with a
                        closely cropped head” had her attempts to satisfy the demanding public
                        continued in this manner (<name>Thomasin Darling</name> 47).</p>
                    <p>Despite this sudden burst of popularity and fame, <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> “shrank from, not courted, the
                        public” (<name>Thomasin Darling</name> 38), behavior that simultaneously
                        reinforced the Victorian conception of her virtuous nature and characterized
                        her as a shy and wild creature threatened by the hungry public
                            (<name>Sitwell</name>). <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>
                        received many offers to be properly introduced to <rs type="place"
                            key="city">London’s</rs> society, some including paid appearances, but
                        she refused all of them. The Duke of <rs type="place" key="county"
                            >Northumberland</rs>, now a family friend and patron, understood <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name> reluctance to embrace her fame
                        and worked to spare her from undesired exhibition. When <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> received letters requesting her
                        appearance at various ceremonies and functions, she informed the Duke and he
                        wrote politely worded refusals on her behalf. Eventually, people began to
                        write to the Duke in order to pass messages on to <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>. Grateful for this understanding
                        and help, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> called the Duke her
                        Guardian and herself his servant (<name>Thomasin Darling</name>).</p>
                    <p>The Duke was not able to shield <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name>
                        from the artistic community, however. The events of that September morning
                        seized the artistic imagination of the era, and painters such as <name>J.W.
                            Carmichael</name> and <name>Thomas Musgrave Joy</name> requested that
                            <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and her father sit for
                        portraits. Many times, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> would be
                        forced to reenact awkward positions in order for the painters to properly
                        portray the scene of the Forfarshire’s shipwreck. There were also many books
                        dedicated to <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name> story. Many of
                        them were written as romances, with loose treatment of the facts of the
                        event. <name>William Wordsworth</name> commemorated <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> and her actions in verse considered
                        to be beautifully and poetically written, but also greatly romanticized and
                        “embarrassing” (ODNB). <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> did not
                        read or pay attention to any of the novels, in keeping with her strict
                        upbringing (<name>Thomasin Darling</name>).</p>
                    <p>She continued to “politely refuse” all offers of paid appearances
                        (Correspondent) and to decline invitations to enter into <rs type="place"
                            key="city">London</rs> society, as <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING"
                            >Grace</name> was content to focus on her chores and duties at Longstone
                        and to remain a companion and helper to her parents. She refused numerous
                        offers of marriage following her rise in fame (<name>Bruce</name>), and
                        “clung to her father and to her name, [explaining] that any husband of hers
                        should take it” (<name>Thomasin Darling</name> 11). She showed no
                        indications of yearning for something more than what she had, and refuted
                        the assumption that her quiet life on the island was unfulfilling, stating
                        that she “[had] no time to spare” as she had “seven apartments in the house
                        to keep in a state fit to be inspected every day by Gentlemen, so that [her]
                        hands [were] kept very busy” (<name>Mitford</name>, 89 and 90). Despite the
                        external clamor and demands of the public, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING"
                            >Grace</name> was satisfied with the quiet confinement, humble industry,
                        and familial duty of the lighthouse. </p>
                    <p>In this way, <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> lived contentedly at
                        the Longstone Lighthouse until a sudden decline in her health occurred after
                        a visit to her oldest brother on <rs type="place" key="Island">Coquet
                            Island</rs> in <dateRange from="1842-01-01" to="1842-12-31"
                            >1842</dateRange>. In the hope of improving her condition, <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name> parents sent her and her sister,
                            <name>Thomasin</name>, to visit a family friend, <name>George
                            Shield</name>, in <rs type="place" key="town">Wooler</rs>
                            (<name>Thomasin Darling</name>, Britain Unlimited). While there, <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> wrote to her parents that she
                        greatly enjoyed spending time with her sister and was beginning to feel
                        better. <name>Thomasin’s</name> letters contradicted <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name> claim, however, as she wrote that
                        her sister’s coughs remained about the same (<name>Thomasin
                        Darling</name>).</p>
                    <p>The two sisters then went to <rs type="place" key="town">Alnwick</rs>, the
                        residence of the Duke of <rs type="place" key="county">Northumberland</rs>,
                        as the Duke had requested that <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> be
                        treated by his personal doctor. <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace’s</name>
                        health never improved, however, and the doctor said that her disease was one
                        which “no skill, nor care, nor kindness could arrest” (<name>Thomasin
                            Darling</name> 56). In one last attempt to save their daughter, the
                            <name>Darlings</name> sent <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> to
                            <name>Thomasin’s</name> home in <rs type="place" key="village"
                            >Bamborough</rs>. Much to everyone’s surprise, <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> began to show signs of increasing
                        health within the first few days in <rs type="place" key="village"
                            >Bamborough</rs>. Despite this short-lived hope, <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> died several days later on
                            <date>October 20th, 1842</date> at the age of twenty-seven, a victim of
                        what is believed to have been tuberculosis (<name>Thomasin Darling</name>,
                        Britain Unlimited). She was buried in St. Aidan’s Churchyard, less than one
                        hundred yards from where she had been born (Britain Unlimited). </p>
                    <p>Though <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> was dead, her fame lived on
                        in literature, art, popular culture, and, most significantly, the national
                        consciousness. As <name>Edith Sitwell</name> put it, “to the last day of her
                        life <name corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace Darling</name> could not see that
                        she had done anything extraordinary…but she became the pride of the nation”
                            (<name>Sitwell</name> 62). Certain types of heroic legend coincided in
                        her, as in the physical courage and prowess of <name corresp="JOAN_OF_ARC"
                            >Joan of Arc</name>, the wild, indigenous innocence and rescue of <name
                            corresp="POCAHONTAS">Pocahontas</name> or Walter Scott's heroines, and
                        other romantic themes apart from love and marriage. In turn, she became a
                        type recognized in other women's deeds around the world, even for
                        predecessors such as the "Grace Darling of Newfoundland," <name>Ann
                            Harvey</name>, who helped to rescue 180 survivors of a shipwreck in
                            <date>1828</date> (Ann Harvey). To the Victorian Era, <name
                            corresp="GRACE_DARLING">Grace</name> stood as an emblem of both <rs
                            type="place" key="kingdom">British</rs> courage and female virtue that
                        resonated deeply with that era's imperialism and idealism. She was a woman
                        with a truly “<rs type="place" key="country">English</rs> heart”
                            (<name>Mitford</name>) who represented the absolute best of her society,
                        and gave its members hope and faith in a time of transition. </p>

                        these women had an honest means of supporting themselves in the colonies;

                        movement (Haan, ODNB). </p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, the commendation in collective biographies suppresses further
                        aspects of Elizabeth Fry's life: <milestone unit="subject"

                        took opium and drank alcohol daily and by the end of her life seems to have
                        become heavily dependent; <milestone unit="subject" corresp="life_events"

                        drawn funds from her husband's bank to support her charities (Rose, 138-9).
                        Yet not all that is conspicuously missing from the biographies concerns
                        unpleasant details from her private life. No presenter takes notice of the
                        public opposition her work received from later, secular men who were
                        professionally engaged in reforming social policy. These male reformers
                        passed over Elizabeth Fry's legacy as amateur charity work done by an
                        old-fashioned, Plain Quaker woman (Haan, ODNB). Thus, the picture we have
                        from contemporary biographies is double-edged. It may be a carefully-crafted
                        figure of moral heroism, diminishing the full human being Elizabeth Fry.
                        Yet, if these early biographers had not canonized her in print during the

                        its connection to humanitarian reform might have been lost, trampled by the

                    </p>
                    <p rend="block">There lived in one of two or three solitary cottages in the wood
                        an old shepherd of her father's, named Roger, who had a favourite sheep-dog
                        called Cap. Roger had neither wife nor child, and Cap lived with him and
                        kept him. . . Cap was a very sensible dog; indeed people used to say he
                        could do everything but speak. He kept the sheep in wonderfully good
                        order.... One day as Florence and her old friend were out for a ride, they
                        came to a field where they found the shepherd giving his sheep their night
                        feed; but he was without the dog, and the sheep knew it, for they were
                        scampering in every direction. . . . They stopped to ask what was the
                        matter, and what had become of his dog.</p>
                    <p rend="block">"Oh," said Roger, "Cap will never be of any more use to me; I'll
                        have to hang him, poor fellow, as soon as I go home to-night. . . , one of
                        the mischievous school boys throwed a stone at him yesterday and broke one
                        of his legs." And the old shepherd's eyes filled with tears, which he wiped
                        away with his shirt-sleeve, then he drove his spade deep in the ground to
                        hide what he felt, for he did not like to be seen crying.</p>
                    <p rend="block">There on the bare brick floor lay the dog, his hair dishevelled,
                        and his eyes sparkling with anger at the intruders. When he looked at
                        Florence and heard her call him "poor Cap," he began to wag his short tail;
                        and then crept from under the table and lay down at her feet. She took hold

                        friend examined the injured leg. It was dreadfully swollen, and hurt very
                        much to have it examined; but the dog knew it was meant kindly, . . . . </p>
                    <p rend="block">"It's only a bad bruise, no bones are broken," said her old
                        friend. "Rest is all Cap needs; he will soon be well again."</p>
                    <p rend="block">"I am so glad," said Florence; "but can we do nothing for him,
                        he seems in such pain?"</p>
                    <p rend="block">"There is one thing that would ease the pain and heal the leg
                        all the sooner, and that is plenty of hot water to foment the part."</p>
                    <p rend="block">Florence struck a light with the tinder-box, and lighted the
                        fire, which was already laid. She then set off to the other cottage to get
                        something to bathe the leg with. She found an old flannel petticoat hanging
                        up to dry, and this she carried off, and tore up into strips, which she
                        wrung out in warm water, and laid them tenderly on Cap's swollen leg. It was
                        not long before the poor dog felt the benefit of the application, and he
                        looked grateful, wagging his little stump of a tail in thanks. . . On the
                        next morning Florence was up early, and the first thing she did was to take
                        two flannel petticoats to give to the poor woman whose skirt she had torn up
                        to bathe Cap. Then she went to the dog, and was delighted to find the
                        swelling of his leg much less. . . . </p>
                    <p rend="block">Two or three days afterward Florence and her friend were riding
                        together, when they came up to Roger and his sheep. This time Cap was
                        watching the sheep, . . . . When he heard the voice of Florence speaking to
                        his master, who was portioning out the usual food, his tail wagged and his
                        eyes sparkled, but he did not get up, for he was on duty. The shepherd
                        stopped his work, and as he glanced at the dog with a merry laugh, said, "Do
                        look at the dog, Miss; he be so pleased to hear your voice." Cap's tail went
                        faster and faster. "I be glad," continued the old man, "I did not hang him.
                        . . ."</p>

                        interesting to hear that her first attempt at nursing was performed on an

                        "that it became a custom when any one had a cut or bruise, or a sick animal,

                        seemingly, of sanitation. Rather than curers the hospitals were breeders of
                        pestilence.</p>

                            Hundreds of men with fever, dysentery and cholera (the wounded were the

                        wounded from the Battle of Inkermann. On their arrival they set at once to
                        the performance of their arduous duties. Indescribably horrible was the
                        state of the hospital when Miss Nightingale made her first inspection.
                        Sanitary arrangements were nil. The beds were reeking with infection.
                        Outside the hospital was a hotbed of pestilence. Hercules' labour in
                        clearing the Augean stables could only be compared to the awful task that
                        lay before those devoted women. A tower at one of the corners of the Barrack
                        Hospital gave them accommodation.</p>
                    <p rend="block">From the first the indomitable will of "the Lady-in-chief," as
                        she was called, made itself felt in every department, which gradually broke
                        down all obstacles raised by the jealousy or bad tempers of the officials.
                        As <name type="presenter">Nolan</name> tells us, <rs

                            they generally regarded these gentle missionaries as a new element of

                            out of chaos; that the hell she had found when she came knew at last the
                            blessing of cleanliness; that the administration of our Levantine
                            hospitals began to seem almost perfect. . . . She brought to her
                            self-imposed task that forethought, that agile brain-power, that
                            organising and governing faculty of which our country had
                        need."</rs></p>
                    <p rend="block">A further staff of fifty trained female nurses had been sent
                        from England to help Miss Nightingale and assistants. There was plenty of
                        work for all. One can only imagine what privations and discomforts those
                        devoted women had to undergo during those months of wearing fatigue and
                        endurance, and it would be difficult to give any idea of their round of
                        daily and nightly duties. They had to do everything for themselves as well
                        as for the patients. </p>

                    <p rend="block">At last the fighting was brought to an end. For a year and a
                        half had the noble and humane work of nursing gone on and shown the world
                        how much greater is the saving of lives than the destruction of lives by the
                        murder of war. The gratitude the English people felt for what the nurses had
                        done they expressed by a gift of fifty thousand pounds to Miss Nightingale
                        after her return to England. They had planned also a public welcome of their
                        heroine, but with the modesty and calm judgment that always characterised
                        her, she slipped quietly into England by the carriage of a French steamer
                        and so to her country home. <name corresp="QUEEN_VICTORIA">Queen
                            Victoria,</name> who with her husband the Prince Consort, had most
                        earnestly admired Miss Nightingale's course, and had sought direct knowledge
                        of her work during her stay in the East, entertained her at Balmoral and
                        presented her with a valuable jewel. The sum presented her by the nation
                        was, at her request, given to the foundation of a training home for nurses
                        in connection with St. Thomas's Hospital. It is called the "Nightingale
                        Home." </p>

                    <p rend="block">At the end of six months the hospital arrangements had been
                        brought into order. Kitchens and laundries had been established. <rs
                            corresp="narrative_elements" ana="quotation_biography">"All England," as
                                <name>Mrs. Tooley</name> tells us in her article, "from <name
                                corresp="QUEEN_VICTORIA">the Queen</name> to the humblest peasant,
                            were making warm garments and preparing lint and bandages for the
                            soldiers. The Patriotic Fund for the relief of the widows and orphans
                            rose by leaps and bounds, until within a year it amounted to one million
                            pounds."</rs></p>
                    <p rend="block">The Queen had already sent Miss Nightingale an auto-graph
                        letter, with a jewelled Cross of St. George, inscribed in letters of gold
                        with the words, "Blessed are the Merciful," and on her return she was
                        summoned to Balmoral. On September 21st she was introduced to the Queen and
                        the Prince Consort by Sir James Clark, with whom she was then staying at
                        Birkhall. <rs corresp="narrative_elements" ana="quotation_documentary">"She
                            put before us," is the brief entry in the Prince's diary, "all the
                            defects of our present military hospital system, and the reforms that
                            are needed. We are much pleased with her. She is extremely
                        modest."</rs></p>
                    <p rend="block">About a fortnight later, we are told, Miss Nightingale became
                        the Queen's guest, "the time of her visit being so fixed as to give Lord
                        Panmure, who was then at Balmoral, an opportunity of learning from her own
                        lips the story of what she had seen and the conclusions she had drawn from
                        her great and remarkable experience in the East."</p>
                    <p rend="block">Florence Nightingale had evaded a public ovation on her return
                        from Scutari, but the magnificent testimonial of fifty thousand pounds was
                        presented by the nation and army, in recognition of her splendid services;
                        but by her request this sum was devoted to the formation of a Training Home
                        for Nurses in connection with St. Thomas's Hospital. It is called "The
                        Nightingale Home," and has a reputation worthy of its founder. </p>

                        Brontë is one of the few writers whose life has assumed as great a presence
                        in the popular imagination as her works themselves. As Lucasta Miller
                        observes in her book <hi rend="italics">The Brontë Myth</hi>, a study of the
                        various afterlives of the Brontë sisters through biography, “the sisters
                        themselves, plus their entire family, have become mythic figures in their
                        own right. Since 1857, when Elizabeth Gaskell published her famous <hi
                            rend="italics">Life of Charlotte Brontë</hi>, hardly a year has gone by
                        without some form of biographical material on the Brontës appearing—from
                        articles in newspapers to full-length lives, from images on tea towels to
                        plays, films, and novelizations” (Miller, xi). The idea of three sisters,
                        the daughters of a lower middle-class curate living an isolated life in a
                        Yorkshire moorland village, producing some of the most complex and moving
                        literature of the century, turned the Brontës into celebrities within their
                        lifetime, and their notoriety has only increased over the years. Their
                        childhood home at Haworth Parsonage has become the site of tourist
                        pilgrimages, where enthusiasts travel to see the attic where the children
                        wrote, in miniscule handwriting, their first imaginative tales. As Miller
                        points out, the popular fascination with the lives of the Brontë sisters
                        often threatens to overshadow serious critical interest in their works.
                        Digging through the cultural accretions of myth and fantasy, however, one
                        can see how powerfully the Brontës’ lives affected their work, and how they
                        transformed an often bleak and tragic existence, marginalized by their
                        geographic location but also by their gender, into the material for art.
                        Though Anne and Emily were also published novelists and poets, Charlotte was
                        the most prolific of the three, and remains the most popular.</p>

                        memory all her life, emerging in her later fiction. The Clergy Daughters'
                        School became Lowood School in <hi rend="italics">Jane Eyre</hi>, and its
                        founder, the Reverend William Carus Wilson, was the model for Mr.
                        Brocklehurst, the hypocritical Calvinistic disciplinarian in that novel.

                            ana="childhood"/>Taking refuge from grief in imaginative play, the four
                        children began to make up stories, opposing the arbitrariness of death with
                        the control of authorship. Their first stories took inspiration from a box
                        of Branwell’s tin soldiers, but as they outgrew these toys, the children
                        established their tales in worlds of their own creation. Not surprisingly,
                        Charlotte and Branwell dominated their younger sisters in these plays, and
                        eventually the siblings split off into two groups—Charlotte and Branwell
                        chronicling the imaginary kingdom of Angria, while Emily and Anne created
                        the alternate world of Gondal (Miller, 5). Sibling rivalry fuelled these
                        endeavors, as well as collaboration, and Charlotte often felt threatened by
                        Branwell’s early sense of entitlement with regard to the male-dominated
                        world of literary production.</p>
                    <p><milestone unit="subject" corresp="life_events" ana="education"/>Charlotte
                        and her siblings were prolific readers as well as writers. Her novels are
                        steeped in literary and biblical allusion, the product of this wide-ranging
                        education in classical and contemporary writers. “Unlike most middle-class
                        Victorian households,” writes Christine Alexander, “there was little
                        censorship of reading in the Brontë parsonage. The Bible was staple fare;
                        yet <rs corresp="agents" ana="father">Patrick Brontë</rs> also encouraged an
                        eclectic diet of Homer, Virgil, Shakespeare, Bunyan, Milton, Pope, Johnson,
                        Gibbon, Cowper, Burns, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Scott, Southey, and Byron”
                        (ODNB). The children also devoured the poetry and prose published in monthly
                        periodicals, such as <hi rend="italics">Blackwood’s Magazine</hi> and <hi
                            rend="italics">Fraser’s</hi>.</p>
                    <p>One of the writers who most influenced Charlotte as an emerging writer was
                        Lord Byron (1788-1824). His poetry furnished her imagination with exotic
                        settings and dashing heroes. Byron’s legacy, writes Miller, can be seen “her
                        obsession with the amours of her aristocratic hero, Zamorna” (Miller, 8).
                        Zamorna became the central focus of Charlotte’s Angrian tales, and it is
                        clear that he captured her imagination in a manner bordering on
                        hero-worship. Tall, dark and Byronic, Zamorna was charismatic and sexually
                        potent. One can see in Zamorna the embryonic form of Brontë’s tortured,
                        brooding hero Mr. Rochester in <hi rend="italics">Jane Eyre</hi>, though
                        Charlotte’s unqualified admiration for this type of character would become
                        more ambivalent and nuanced over the intervening years.</p>
                    <p><milestone unit="subject" corresp="life_events" ana="education"/>In January
                        1831, Charlotte was sent to the <rs corresp="places" ana="school">Roe Head
                            School</rs>, about 15 miles from home. This second experience with
                        institutional education was much more positive than the first. Charlotte
                        worked hard at her studies, and formed several lasting friendships. Two
                        women in particular would become lifelong friends and correspondents: “the
                        conscientious, calm, religious <rs corresp="agents" ana="friend">Ellen
                            Nussey</rs> who fulfilled Charlotte's dutiful self and need for
                        affection, and the fiercely independent <rs corresp="agents" ana="friend"
                            >Mary Taylor</rs>, whose radical views on politics, women, and religion
                        fuelled Charlotte's ambitious and rebellious nature” (ODNB). In many ways
                        these two very different women exemplified a split in Charlotte’s nature,
                        which tension would emerge in her writing. Charlotte would often express
                        feelings of doubt and guilt over the working of her “fiery imagination” in
                        letters to <rs corresp="agents" ana="friend">Ellen Nussey</rs>, worrying
                        that the content of her writing was not appropriate for a clergyman’s
                        daughter (Miller, 12). Though she stayed at Roe Head for only eighteen
                        months as a pupil, Charlotte excelled in French and drawing, as well as
                        continuing to write.</p>
                    <p>Charlotte went back to Haworth briefly, but returned to Roe Head in July
                        1835, this time as a teacher. Charlotte remained there for three and a half
                        years. She soon became impatient however, at the strictures of the life she
                        was leading. Charlotte confessed to her journal her frustrations with her
                        straitjacketed world: <rs corresp="narrative_elements"
                            ana="quotation_writing_by_subject">“The thought came over me: am I to

                            most asinine stupidity of those fatheaded oafs, and on compulsion

                    <p><milestone unit="subject" corresp="life_events" ana="vocation"/>She continued
                        to harbor literary ambitions secretly while at Roe Head. Once, while on
                        holiday, she sent some of her poems to Robert Southey, the Poet Laureate of
                        England. This was an audacious move, and Charlotte revealed to him in her
                        letter her desire “to be forever known” (Miller, 10). <rs
                            corresp="narrative_elements" ana="quotation_letter">Southey was gracious
                            enough to write back, but his response was far from encouraging. He
                            admitted that she possessed “the faculty of Verse,” but declared
                            unequivocally that “Literature cannot be the business of a woman’s life:
                            &amp; it ought not to be.” He advised her to attend to her “proper
                            duties” as a woman, and to be “less eager for celebrity” (Miller
                            12).</rs> Chastised, Charlotte responded that she attempted to repress
                        herself and conceal her ambitions from those around her. The accusation that
                        her ambitions were “unfeminine” would plague Charlotte all her life.</p>
                    <p>Charlotte felt increasingly guilty about her continued indulgence of her
                        Angrian fantasies, which nurtured her passionate desire to be loved and
                        understood. John Maynard points to Charlotte’s continued obsession with the
                        hyper-masculine Zamorna, while a teacher at Roe Head. At nineteen years of
                        age, escaping the “mirthless, lifeless room” at the school, she recorded
                        this daydream:</p>
                    <p rend="block"><rs corresp="narrative_elements"
                            ana="quotation_writing_by_subject">Never shall I, Charlotte Brontë,
                            forget…how distinctly I, sitting in the school-room at Roe-head, saw the
                            Duke of Zamorna…his black horse turned loose grazing among the heather,
                            the moonlight so mild and so exquisitely tranquil, sleeping upon that
                            vast and vacant road…I was quite gone. I had really utterly forgot where
                            I was and all the gloom and cheerlessness of my situation. I felt myself
                            breathing quick and short as I beheld the Duke lifting up his sable
                            crest which undulated as the plume of a hearse waves to the wind, and
                            knew that that music…was exciting him and quickening his ever rapid
                            pulse.</rs> (Maynard, 13-14)</p>
                    <p>Charlotte worried that this kind of passionate fantasy was unwholesome, and
                        confessed her doubts to <rs corresp="agents" ana="friend">Ellen Nussey</rs>.
                            <rs corresp="narrative_rhetoric" ana="advice">Nussey’s conventional
                            Christian advice only increased Charlotte’s sense of her own
                            sinfulness.</rs> Charlotte left Roe Head in 1838, chastened and sobered
                        by her experiences, but not quenched in her literary ambition.</p>
                    <p>Returning home, Charlotte continued to write; two more novellas in the
                        Angrian mode concluded her involvement in the saga. “Although Angria
                        continued to provide material for future characterization, scene, and
                        theme,” writes Alexander, “she made a distinct move towards artistic
                        independence from both her brother and her private world” (ODNB).</p>
                    <p>In 1839, Charlotte received two proposals of marriage, both of which she
                        refused. The first was from the Reverend Henry Nussey, Ellen’s brother. The
                        second was from the Reverend James Bryce, an Irish clergyman whom she barely
                        knew. Nussey’s passionless and pious proposal formed the basis for
                        Charlotte’s portrayal of St. John Rivers in <hi rend="italics">Jane
                            Eyre</hi>. Both Charlotte and Jane’s refusal of such matches would have
                        been considered imprudent and even shocking in Brontë’s time. It was
                        somewhat radical to refuse a respectable offer and to hold out for a
                        marriage based on love. Either Nussey or Bryce would have been considered an
                        eminently suitable match for Charlotte; if she had accepted one of them, it
                        would have obviated the need to hire herself out as a governess, one of the
                        few respectable career options available to a woman of her class.</p>
                    <p>Following this, Charlotte endured two brief stints as a governess, a position
                        she enjoyed even less than teaching. Brontë’s resentment of the treatment
                        she received, and the tendency of the upper classes to treat governesses as
                        subhuman, would emerge in her fiction, much of which dealt with the
                        humiliations endured by women forced to earn their living in these degrading
                        circumstances. </p>
                    <p>Returning home in 1841, Charlotte began to make plans with Emily and Anne to
                        open their own school. However, the sisters felt they could attract more
                        pupils if their language skills were more robust. Plans for the school were
                        postponed in favor of a scheme in which Charlotte and Emily would enroll at
                        a school in <rs corresp="places" ana="city">Brussels</rs> in order to

                        and encouraged her literary ambitions. Heger was, by all accounts, a strict
                        master, and his comments on the Brontës’ French compositions show that he
                        did not spare his criticism, even though he was impressed by the abilities
                        of these young Englishwomen.</p>

                            loneliness and depression.</rs> (She would later use this time in her
                        life as material for her novels <hi rend="italics">The Professor</hi> and
                            <hi rend="italics">Villette</hi>.) By the end of 1843, Charlotte had
                        decided to return to Haworth.</p>
                    <p>Charlotte’s depression deepened upon her return to <rs corresp="places"
                            ana="nation">England</rs>. Plans for the girls’ school fell through, and
                        Charlotte longed for the company of M. Heger. She wrote him a series of
                        increasingly desperate and passionate letters, to which he did not reply.
                        Charlotte’s unrequited love tortured her, and she begged Heger to write back
                        to her. Wounded by his silence, Charlotte discontinued her correspondence
                        with him.</p>
                    <p>Her private suffering was compounded by shared family trials, when <rs
                            corresp="agents" ana="brother">Branwell</rs> was dismissed in disgrace
                        from his post as tutor for having an affair with his employer’s wife.
                        Branwell led a dissipated and self-destructive life after this, nursing his
                        addiction to alcohol and opium. Charlotte’s brother became a strain on his
                        family and his health began a rapid decline.</p>
                    <p>Once again, Charlotte took refuge from grief in work, focusing on her goal of
                        becoming a published writer. In 1845, she discovered a notebook containing
                        Emily’s poetry, and persuaded her that they merited publication. Charlotte,
                        Emily and Anne edited and selected a portion of their verse and submitted it
                        for consideration. They chose androgynous pseudonyms to avoid criticism
                        based on their gender. <hi rend="italics">Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton
                            Bell</hi> was published in 1846 by Aylott and Jones, at the authors’
                        expense (using money from their aunt’s legacy). The book sold only two
                        copies, but received several favorable reviews, which was enough to
                        encourage the sisters to continue.</p>
                    <p>The three began to work on prose next, perfecting their novels in the hopes
                        of publication. Charlotte drew on her Brussels experience for her first
                        novel, <hi rend="italics">The Professor</hi>. Emily wrote <hi rend="italics"
                            >Wuthering Heights</hi>, reworking her Gondal saga in an English
                        setting, and Anne wrote <hi rend="italics">Agnes Grey</hi>, based on her
                        life as a governess (ODNB). All three sent their manuscripts to publishers
                        for consideration. <hi rend="italics">Wuthering Heights</hi> and <hi
                            rend="italics">Agnes Grey</hi> were accepted by Thomas Cautley Newby in
                        July 1847, but <hi rend="italics">The Professor</hi> was not so well
                        received. Christine Alexander points out that Charlotte wrote <hi
                            rend="italics">The Professor</hi> in reaction against her Angrian
                        fantasies (ODNB). In what is now known as “The Farewell to Angria” (1839),
                        Charlotte had expressed her determination to “quit for awhile that burning
                        clime where we have sojourned too long…lit with love, flushed with passion,
                        shaded with grief, kindled with ecstasy,” and move “to a cooler region where
                        the dawn breaks grey and sober” (Maynard, 14). Alexander argues that the
                        result of this artistic decision was a novel stiff and detached, not true to
                        its author’s emotional experiences and inner knowledge. <hi rend="italics"
                            >The Professor</hi> was never published during Charlotte’s lifetime.</p>
                    <p>However, the firm of Smith, Elder &amp; Co. had offered encouragement in
                        their rejection letter, indicating that they would be interested to read
                        anything Charlotte might send to them in future. By August 1847, Charlotte
                        had sent them the manuscript of <hi rend="italics">Jane Eyre</hi>. George
                        Smith, one of the publishers, recorded that he was so engrossed when he
                        began to read the novel that he cancelled his plans to go out riding with a
                        friend and skipped dinner in order to finish it in one sitting (Miller, 16).
                        The next day he wrote to “Currer Bell” to offer £100 for the copyright. <hi
                            rend="italics">Jane Eyre</hi> was published in October 1847 and was an
                        instant bestseller. The novel also received critical acclaim: literary
                        celebrities such as G. H. Lewes and William Makepeace Thackeray praised
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Semi-autobiographical in content, <hi rend="italics">Jane Eyre</hi> is the
                        story of an unloved orphan whose experience of suffering and neglect fail to
                        subdue her passion and will to become independent. Charlotte Brontë finally
                        found her voice in <hi rend="italics">Jane Eyre</hi>. Casting aside the
                        dispassionate third-person male narration of <hi rend="italics">The
                            Professor</hi>, Brontë audaciously adopted the voice of Jane, a
                        first-person female narrator. Jane’s insistence on her sense of self-worth
                        and dignity, in spite of her gender and social position, was a powerful
                        critique of mid-Victorian life, and not surprisingly, ruffled quite a few
                        feathers.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italics">Jane Eyre</hi>’s psychologically astute portrayal of a
                        female voice and perspective led many readers to assume that its author was,
                        in fact, a woman. Some readers, especially women, were shocked by the
                        novel’s frank depiction of passionate desire, its discussion of adultery,
                        and sometimes angry and rebellious tone. Elizabeth Rigby (later Lady
                        Eastlake) expressed the disapproval felt by some readers most memorably, in
                        her anonymous critique, published in the <hi rend="italics">Quarterly
                            Review</hi> in December 1848. Rigby deplored the novel’s “coarseness of
                        language and laxity of tone” and described Jane’s independent spirit as
                        unfeminine. She condemned the novel as “anti-Christian” and the heroine as
                        “the personification of an unregenerate and undisciplined spirit” who had
                        “the strength of a mere heathen mind which is a law unto itself.” If, as had
                        been speculated, the author was indeed a woman, Rigby declared that she must
                        be one who “has for some sufficient reason, long forfeited the society of
                        her own sex” (Miller, 22-23).</p>
                    <p>It is ironic that the assumption of an androgynous pseudonym, rather than
                        shielding Charlotte from censure, should have led to such vicious gossip and
                        speculation. Charlotte dedicated her second edition of <hi rend="italics"
                            >Jane Eyre</hi> to Thackeray, unaware that such a move was likely to
                        spark more gossip. Thackeray, like Rochester, had a wife who was mentally
                        ill, leading to rumors that <hi rend="italics">Jane Eyre</hi> had been
                        written by Thackeray’s mistress.</p>
                    <p>Charlotte finally revealed her true identity to her publishers, after Thomas
                        Newby attempted to capitalize on the popularity of Charlotte’s recent novel
                        by claiming that <hi rend="italics">Agnes Grey</hi> and <hi rend="italics"
                            >Wuthering Heights</hi> were written by the same author as <hi

                            rend="italics">Shirley</hi> was not as successful as <hi rend="italics"
                            >Jane Eyre</hi>, but nevertheless, it did address important social
                        issues of the day. This novel was Charlotte’s attempt to address the
                        “condition of women” issue, as well as the class conflicts of
                        industrialization. Avoiding the topics that had aroused such scandal with
                            <hi rend="italics">Jane Eyre</hi>, Charlotte declared that <hi
                            rend="italics">Shirley</hi> would be “as unromantic as Monday morning”
                        (ODNB). This foray into strict realism did not produce Brontë’s most
                        powerful work, but <hi rend="italics">Shirley</hi> is still an ambitious and
                        masterful novel.</p>
                    <p>While Charlotte kept her identity a secret from the public, for the time
                        being, she was curious to meet the literary celebrities of <rs
                            corresp="places" ana="city">London</rs>, and asked George Smith to
                        introduce her to some of them when she stayed with him and his mother in
                        1849 and 1850. There she met such prominent writers as Thackeray and Lewes,
                        who noted her shyness and her lack beauty. <milestone unit="subject"
                            corresp="narrative_rhetoric" ana="topos_appearance"/>Charlotte had
                        always been self-conscious about her unimpressive physicality, and it seems
                        these encounters caused her more uneasiness than pleasure. She also met <rs
                            corresp="agents" ana="friend">Elizabeth Gaskell</rs> on a trip to <rs
                            corresp="places" ana="city">Edinburgh</rs> in 1850. Gaskell was a
                        novelist who would become Charlotte’s friend and confidant, and later, her
                        first biographer.</p>
                    <p>The criticism she had received for <hi rend="italics">Jane Eyre</hi> still
                        rankled, however, and now that her sisters were dead, there was no longer as
                        much reason for concealing the sisters’ true identity. (Emily had been the
                        most fiercely protective of her privacy.) Charlotte decided to clear her
                        reputation, as well as her sisters’. She issued a second edition of <hi
                            rend="italics">Agnes Grey</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Wuthering
                            Heights</hi> (this time published by Smith, Elder &amp; Co.) with a
                        “Biographical Notice” appended to it, in which she revealed her sisters’
                        true identity and defended their work. However, the defensive tone that she
                        adopts is also curiously apologetic, and seems to infantilize Emily and
                        Anne. Charlotte protests that her sisters were merely ignorant Yorkshire
                        girls who didn’t know any better, and didn’t mean to offend. She describes
                        Haworth as a “remote district where education had made little progress”
                        (Miller, 28), urging this in extenuation of her sisters’ errors. This
                        depiction was certainly an act of misrepresentation, albeit sincerely meant.
                        In the introduction to her seminal biography of the Brontës, Juliet Barker
                        describes how she trawled through the archives of local newspapers published
                        in the time of the Brontës, unearthing a large amount of information that
                        controverts <rs corresp="narrative_elements" ana="quotation_biography">"the
                            myth that Haworth was a remote and obscure village where nothing ever
                            happened. It was a township, a small, industrial town in the heart of a
                            much larger chapelry, where politics and religion were hotly disputed
                            and culture thrived”</rs> (Barker, xix).</p>
                    <p>However, if the view of <rs corresp="places" ana="rural_setting">Haworth
                            Parsonage as a completely isolated landmark in the midst of
                            unadulterated moorland</rs> is a popular myth, as both Miller and Barker
                        observe, it is a myth that is partly of Charlotte Brontë’s own making. This
                        myth was embellished by Elizabeth Gaskell in her famous <hi rend="italics"
                            >Life of Charlotte Brontë</hi>, which attempted to portray Charlotte as
                        a dutiful, self-denying woman—sanitizing anything controversial in her works
                        or papers. Gaskell discusses Brontë’s career as an author in gendered terms,
                        seeing the role of author and the role of woman as competing for first place
                        in Charlotte’s priorities. Gaskell emphasizes her belief that for Charlotte,
                        the duties of womanhood always came first. “When a man becomes an author,”
                        writes Gaskell, “it is probably merely a change of employment to
                        him…[another] steps into his vacant place, and probably does as well as he.”
                        For a woman, however, cannot shirk her domestic responsibilities to pursue a
                        career:</p>
                    <p rend="block"><rs corresp="narrative_elements" ana="quotation_biography">But
                            no other can take up the quiet regular duties of the daughter, the wife,
                            or the mother, as well as she whom God has appointed to fill that
                            particular place: a woman’s principal work in life is hardly left to her
                            own choice; nor can she drop the domestic charges devolving on her as an
                            individual, for the exercise of the most splendid talents that were ever
                            bestowed.</rs> (Gaskell, 271-272)</p>
                    <p>Gaskell was obviously at pains to prove to the world that Charlotte did not
                        neglect her “principal work” as a woman in order to exercise her talents,
                        that she was a dutiful daughter and sister, without unfeminine ambitions. As
                        Gaskell’s biography was commissioned by <rs corresp="agents" ana="father"
                            >Patrick Brontë</rs> to fight the “misrepresentations” that had sullied
                        his daughter’s image, such an idealized portrayal of Charlotte is hardly
                        surprising (Miller, 64). Gaskell’s portrayal continued to influence popular
                        and scholarly conceptions of Charlotte’s life, and it is only recently that
                        the larger picture has begun to be pieced together.</p>
                    <p>In her last completed novel, <hi rend="italics">Villette</hi>, Charlotte
                        reworked the material she had previously used in <hi rend="italics">The
                            Professor</hi>, again drawing on her experiences in Brussels and her
                        unrequited love for Constantin Heger. In <hi rend="italics">Villette</hi>,
                        Charlotte returned to the first-person female narrator, this time the
                        character Lucy Snowe, who travels to Villette, an imaginary version of
                        Brussels, to teach in a girls’ school. Lucy is in some ways a more complex,
                        although less likeable, narrator than Jane Eyre. Her paranoia and secrecy
                        lead her to conceal information, even from the reader. <hi rend="italics"
                            >Villette</hi> contains the promise of fulfillment in love, but the
                        ending remains ambiguous.</p>
                    <p>Published in January 1843, <hi rend="italics">Villette</hi> met with mixed
                        reviews. Thackeray characteristically attributed the heroine’s longing for
                        love to the author herself. “Poor little woman of genius!” he wrote to a
                        friend, “She wants some Tomkins or another to love her and be in love with.
                        But you see she is a little bit of a creature without a pennyworth of good
                        looks…and no Tomkins will come” (Maynard, 15). Like Gaskell, Thackeray
                        implies that women can gain true fulfillment only in conventional
                        domesticity; literary achievement is a sort of consolation prize.</p>
                    <p>Ironically, Charlotte would soon after achieve the kind of domestic happiness
                        from which Thackeray thought she was permanently excluded. <milestone

                            corresp="narrative_rhetoric" ana="prophecy">but this same daughter was
                            destined to become world-famous, and to bring countless visitors into
                            the neighbourhood of Bristol, both during her life and after her
                            death.</rs> At eight years old we see little Hannah the happy possessor
                        of a long-coveted "whole quire of writing-paper," which it had not needed
                        much coaxing for her to obtain from her observant mother. <rs
                            corresp="agents" ana="mother">Mrs Jacob More</rs> was one of Nature's
                        gentlewomen, and though only a farmer's daughter, she was a person of
                        vigorous intellect, who fully appreciated the value of education, and had
                        made the most of her own rather narrow possibilities. Bearing in mind the
                        efforts of her later years, it is interesting to notice that Hannah More's
                        first attempts in religious literature were letters to imaginary people of
                        depraved character and their replies thereto, full of contrition and
                        promises of amendment!</p>
                    <p><rs corresp="history" ana="church">The evangelical piety of Hannah More is
                            rather remarkable, when one considers that her father was a staunch Tory
                            and High Churchman.</rs> Perhaps it would be more correct to say that it
                        seems remarkable at first sight; for it has been noticed that a
                        Nonconformist strain is frequently productive of conspicuous piety in the
                        families of High Church religionists. Three generations had passed since the
                        time when Jacob More's ancestors had fought bravely as captains in
                        Cromwell's army, and it is probable that the precocious child heard many
                        stirring stories of their doings in the time of the Commonwealth, which
                        intensified the personal and fiery interest with which she afterwards
                        watched the Revolution of 1793. <rs corresp="narrative_rhetoric"

                        nursery floor was often the stage whereon, in carriages made of their
                        high-backed chairs, the child played at excursions to London, and drove with
                        her sisters "to see Bishops and Booksellers"—a curious combination, when one
                        remembers the happy experiences which she subsequently enjoyed with Porteous
                        and Cadell.</p>

                    <p>At this time Hannah More was only thirteen, so that the statements as to her
                        having been a chief promoter of the school are altogether incorrect and
                        absurd. <rs corresp="agents" ana="sister">Mary More</rs>, then barely
                        twenty-one, seems to have been one of those thoroughly unselfish women of
                        whom there are but too few; and she delighted in developing the taste for
                        languages and literature which her more gifted younger sister very early
                        evinced. The school prospered from the first,—and no wonder, for the
                        mistresses were no ordinary women; <rs corresp="narrative_rhetoric"
                            ana="topos_influence">and from their wise teaching scores of girls went
                            out, strengthened in principle as well as richer in knowledge, into a
                            world where "it was the fashion to be irreligious."</rs></p>
                    <p> Hannah took her share in the school duties when she was old enough to do so;
                        but at twenty-two years of age a wealthy but elderly admirer appeared upon
                        the scene, and her engagement, to Mr Turner of Wraxall, was doubtless a
                        source of much satisfaction to the little circle, who in 1762 had moved to a
                        large house in Park Street.</p>
                    <p>The street still remains, and the house is now known as "Hannah More Hall."
                        …For six years the curious courtship continued; but at the last moment the
                        gentleman decided that he did not feel equal to the responsibilities of
                        matrimony, and, after compensating his Amaryllis for her "blighted hopes"
                        with an annuity variously computed at £200 and £400 per annum, he died a
                        bachelor. To the last this quaint pair entertained a "cordial respect" for
                        each other, and <rs corresp="narrative_elements" ana="discriminated_event">
                            by his will she found herself the possessor of a legacy of £1000.</rs>
                        <rs corresp="subject_type" ana="writer">The annuity enabled her to feel
                            independent and to devote herself to the study of literature, for which
                            she was really far more suited than to the consideration of the "varying
                            moods" of a middle-aged landowner. The literary world is distinctly the
                            richer</rs>, so that we are able honestly to rejoice at the capricious
                        conduct of the vacillating lover.</p>
                    <p> Her first work, 'The Search after Happiness,' published in 1773, was an
                        immediate success, and at once secured her a footing among the distinguished
                        writers of that day. At twenty-eight the obscure schoolmaster's daughter
                        awoke to find herself famous. It was a far cry from Bristol to London in
                        those days. George Stephenson was still unborn, and the natural terrors of
                        the journey were increased by the hordes of highwaymen with which the roads
                        were infested.</p>
                    <p>It is a red-letter day when, <rs corresp="narrative_elements" ana="movement">
                            in 1773, Hannah More starts on her first pilgrimage to London.</rs>
                        Every step of the way is fraught with interest to the young traveller, whose
                        ideal, <name>Samuel Johnson</name>, looms in elephantine grandeur as at the
                        farther side of a great gulf. She has heard of him, read of him, dreamed of
                        him, and now she is to see her hero—the scarred, uncouth scholar whose
                        brilliant intellect could make even his enemies admire and tremble and who
                        has had the solitary glory of creating a faithful biographer.</p>
                    <p> Arrived in London, she is the cynosure of all eyes; and as if to prove that
                        Barabbas was not a publisher, T. Cadell of the Strand made her the handsome
                        offer of the same remuneration for 'Sir Eldred of the Bower' and the
                        'Bleeding Well' as Goldsmith had received for the 'Deserted Village'—"be it
                        what it might." This now "unconsidered trifle" was then much praised—and,
                        what is still more remarkable, and certainly not in the very least a matter
                        of sequence, it was also much read.</p>
                    <p> (The following are Green-Armytage’s personal assessments, in 1908, of
                        Augustine Birrell’s criticism of Hannah More in Birrell’s Collected Essays:
                        Res Judicatae (1892).) Hannah More among the prophets and Hannah More as a
                        humorist are, possibly, characterisations under which she has not appeared
                        upon any stage within the last fifty years. But this is a generation that
                        knows not Hannah! and certainly, whoever else knows anything about her, Mr
                            <name>Augustine Birrell</name> does not. He may have read her Life and
                        Works from cover to cover, but a man only gets out of a book that which he
                        himself is capable of assimilating, and Mr Birrell is evidently not en
                        rapport with his subject, and had better have left his unworthy Essay
                        unwritten.</p>
                    <p> It has a spurious smartness about it which makes its misstatements all the
                        more distasteful to an earnest student of her time, especially when coupled
                        with a condescending air of patronage and superiority which sits ill upon a
                        man who has not done, and could not do, one tithe of the work that was done
                        by this delicate woman.</p>
                    <p>As <name>Charles Lamb</name> whimsically said, "She is not Hany More," and Mr
                        Birrell can therefore criticize as harshly as he thinks fit; but with men
                        like Johnson, Garrick, Pitt, Wesley, and Macaulay as counsel for the
                        defence, even her greatest admirers of to-day can afford to smile. In his
                        self-evident desire to be smart, he has forgotten alike the "scrupulous
                        justice which belongs to critics and the delicacy towards the sex which
                        belongs to gentlemen," with which the 'British Review' wrote of her in 1811.
                        To speak of an old woman and a dead woman as a "huge conger-eel floundering
                        in a sea of dingy morality" may be smart writing, but its taste is
                        questionable, to say the least. The careless condescension with which, in
                        later years, he acknowledges her lineaments to be "very pleasant" is almost
                        comical, when one looks at the strong sweet old face with its halo of silver
                        curls, to which Time has but added the beautiful serenity of a well-spent
                        life.</p>

                            who were triumphantly declared successful by a large majority. This
                            election, "the most interesting that ever took place in Bristol," must
                            have been a time of unwonted excitement for the quiet sisterhood…</rs>

                        intellectual gaieties which the best society afforded. Her account of the

                        and her letters are brimming with vivacity and observant shrewdness,
                        verifying her own declaration in her seventy-first year, <rs

                            naturally gay. This gayety even time and sickness have not much

                            frequent attacks of very severe sickness could have kept me in tolerable

                    <p>Her tragedy of "Percy" was produced at Covent Garden Theatre in 1777. Four
                        thousand copies of the "book o' the words'' were sold in a fortnight, and
                        the play itself had an unusually long run, Garrick taking the principal
                        character, and enriching the performance by a prologue and epilogue of his
                        own.</p>
                    <p>This tragedy seems to have made the greatest success of any of her plays, and
                        excited the emotions alike of rich and poor. Johnson, Garrick, and Pitt
                        united in praising it, and the author's place in the literary world was
                        definitely secured. For several years she lived a life of adulation, but
                        throughout it all she held tight on to her Sundays, and maintained a degree
                        of real simpleness which could only be regarded as remarkable, were not her
                        early influences taken into account. <rs corresp="narrative_elements"

                            afterwards," and of the truth of this Hannah More is an example.</rs>
                        The purity of her life remained untouched, and if to our modern notions she
                        sometimes appears almost "priggish," it must be remembered that the line
                        between faith and unfaith was more sharply defined in her day than it is
                        now, and she was bold to avow that "Propriety is to a woman what the great
                        Roman critic said that action is to an orator,—it is the first, the second,
                        and the third requisite."</p>
                    <p>The strange millinery of the upper classes did not escape her observant eye,
                        and both she and Garrick succeeded, by ridiculing the prevailing fashion, in
                        putting a stop to the kitchen-gardens and flower-plots which ladies then
                        wore upon their heads.</p>

                            where she had but lately witnessed him performing as Macbeth, made her
                            resolve definitely to devote her talents to higher uses.</rs>
                        <name>David Garrick</name> was buried in 1779, amid great mourning and
                        splendid pomp, in the great Abbey of Westminster, but on the very night of
                        his funeral the play-houses were as crowded as if no such thing had
                        occurred, and the mourners of the day shared in all the revelries of the
                        night. Such a satire upon "the fashion of this world" helped no doubt to
                        intensify the sadness of his sudden death, and from that time the brilliant
                        life of London, with all its triumphs and successes, seems to have palled
                        upon her. With a woman of her nature this was no mere "phase," resulting
                        from the painful emotions of the time, but a gradual deepening of an innate
                        piety, for which thousands have had reason to be thankful. Never again did
                        she enter a theatre, even when Sarah Siddons was taking a prominent part in
                        "Percy," and we cannot but admire the consistent striving after the
                        "highest," which is the keynote of all her subsequent career.</p>
                    <p>In 1785 we see her installed as mistress of a tiny house called "Cowslip
                        Green," about ten miles from Cheddar; and when in 1789 her sisters gave up
                        the Park Street school and settled in Pulteney Street, Bath, she spent part
                        of every winter with them, and part with <rs corresp="agents" ana="friend">

                        respect. John Wesley much deprecated her retirement to the country, and sent
                        her a message more emphatic than grammatical, which runs thus—</p>
                    <p rend="block">Tell her," said he, "to live in the world. There is her sphere
                        of usefulness. They will not let us come near them."</p>
                    <p>But retreat did not mean idleness, and, from the quiet village of Wrington,
                        year by year issued pamphlets and tracts, which circulated in millions, and
                        were instrumental in counteracting the torrent of infidel and licentious
                        literature which threatened to inundate and undermine England—her religion
                        and her government. Realising the enormous influence wielded by those in the
                        van of society, she published an anonymous pamphlet on 'The Religion of the
                        Fashionable World,' and, in spite of the absence of "original thought and
                        happy phrases" which Mr Birrell deplores, its authorship was speedily
                        discovered by Dr Porteous, Bishop of London, who at once declared "Aut

                        post with laudatory reviews recommending its propagation in her own
                        neighbourhood. It sold by the thousands….</p>

                            visited the sisters at Cowslip Green, and during his visit an immense
                            impulse was given to their work among the poor of the
                            neighbourhood.</rs> After visiting the magnificent gorge known as
                        "Cheddar Cliffs" he was observed to be unusually silent, but in the evening
                        he exclaimed, a propos of the amazing ignorance of the people there, "Miss

                        the expense." This was practically another turning-point in the life of Mrs
                        Hannah More; and her familiarity with the cottagers, her own tireless energy
                        and abounding sympathy, enabled her to write as powerfully of "Tom White the
                        Postilion" and "Black Giles the Poacher," as she had written before in
                        'Hints to a Princess' and 'The Manners of the Great.'</p>

                        lived in a world of their own—less than half-civilised; and even among the
                        farmers, the only argument for the better education of the children that had
                        any effect was that "while they were at Sunday-school they could not be
                        robbing orchards."</p>
                    <p>But these women worked on undauntedly—through evil and good report—with the
                        energy of the Old and the sweetness of the New Dispensation, until schools
                        and scholars were alike established, and out of a seeming Chaos order and
                        discipline were evolved.</p>
                    <p>"Something must be done," Wilberforce had said, and "Miss Hannah" did it. She
                        aimed at the highest, but protested most strongly against making the poor
                        into philosophers. Her desire to keep them in their proper place is now out
                        of fashion, and the School Boards of 1906 would scoff at the short and
                        simple lessons of 1799. Her theory was, "suitable education for each and
                        Christian education for all," and the wedding-present for a girl who was
                        married from Hannah More's schools was "a pair of white stockings knitted by
                        herself, five shillings, and a Bible."…</p>

                        also had a sprightly fancy and a ready pen. This sister we may fairly
                        suppose to have been the most akin to "Miss Hannah," as hers is the name
                        which occurs most frequently in connection with the social and literary
                        interests of the latter; but all the five, in their devotion to one another,
                        are perhaps unique in domestic annals. Of these tracts the most popular was
                        'The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain,' the hero of which was modelled on a man
                        whom she herself had met. The extraordinary sale of 1,000,000 copies shows
                        its admirable suitability to, and popularity with, the class for whom it, as
                        well as the other tracts, was written.</p>
                    <p>The atmosphere of Barley Wood was often enlivened by visits from Zachary
                        Macaulay's son, little Thomas Babington, afterwards Lord Macaulay…</p>
                    <p>It was Hannah More who first started Lord Macaulay's library, writing to
                        advise him, when only six years old, to "lay a little tiny corner-stone" for
                        the same. She was said to have had the rare gift of knowing how to live with
                        both young and old, and she often kept Macaulay with her for weeks together,
                        the youthful prodigy meanwhile declaiming poetry and reading prose by the
                        hour. His subsequent appreciation of moral goodness and his persevering
                        energy in acquiring knowledge may be fairly traced to the influences of his
                        childhood; but his "negativism" on religious subjects is a matter of
                        surprise and regret, and his old friend of Barley Wood so deeply felt his
                        defection "from the party of the saints to the party of the Whigs," as Mr
                        Maurice significantly says, that she changed her intention of leaving him
                        her own valuable library, as a testimony of her disapproval.</p>
                    <p>With little outward eventfulness flowed on those next few years, save for the
                        inevitable visits of death, until in 1819 the last blow was struck in the
                        passing away of Patty, whose loving co-operation and care had cheered every
                        step of her career from the time when the little sisters had sung themselves
                        to sleep in the nursery bed at Stapleton…</p>
                    <p>Unfitted by ill-health, temperament, and having to cope with the
                        deceitfulness of servants, she determined to move into Clifton, and in a
                        smaller house, with a fresh staff of servants, to begin another chapter of
                        her life—at eighty-three years of age. Three days a-week, from twelve to
                        three o'clock, were set apart for the reception of visitors, and when
                        remonstrated with for thus fatiguing herself, the unselfish old lady had
                        always four reasons ready, which she considered unanswerable—If old, she saw
                        them "out of respect; if young, hoping to do them good; if from a distance,
                        because they had come from far; if from near home, because neighbours would
                        be naturally aggrieved at being excluded when she was open to receiving
                        strangers."</p>
                    <p>As her strength for earthly journeyings declined, her thoughts centred more
                        and more on the "land of far distances," and she realised fully that the
                        time of her departure was at hand. Her final illness lasted for eleven
                        months—long enough for a whole treasury of dying sayings; but the "gayety"
                        of which she spoke in her seventy-first year never forsook her, and is not
                        one of the least charming traits in the character of this quiet
                        reformer.</p>
                    <p>
                        <rs corresp="genre_conventions" ana="resolution">On the 7th of September the
                            end came, and after lying in a semi-delirious state for many hours, she
                            passed away, murmuring as her last conscious words, "Patty—joy."</rs>
                    </p>
                    <p>There is a deep pathos in the association of the words. One could almost
                        believe that a glimpse of that beloved sister who had shared in so much of
                        her earthly happiness was vouchsafed to her, waiting perhaps to welcome her
                        within the golden gates of that beautiful country wherein is "fulness of
                        joy, and pleasures for evermore."</p>
                    <p>On the 13th of September 1833, every church in Bristol rang a muffled peal,
                        and the tired body of Hannah More was laid to rest in Wrington churchyard,
                        amid every manifestation of respectful mourning. There lie the five More
                        sisters, of whom Johnson had said, "I love you all!"…</p>
                    <p>Judged by the present pyrotechnic style of literary composition, the success
                        of her work seems phenomenal; but in her day books were not so much a matter
                        of daily outputting as now, and for a publisher to be delivered into the
                        hands of a woman was a welcome novelty.</p>
                    <p>Phrases, too, which to us seem "stilted" almost to absurdity, were then only
                        the courtesies of everyday life—so much is the standard of politeness in its
                        decadence.</p>
                    <p>
                        <rs corresp="narrative_rhetoric" ana="topos_influence">But it is not too
                            much to say that Hannah More will always be remembered with respectful
                            admiration, even by men of more literary culture than William
                            Wilberforce, who said that he would "rather appear in Heaven as the
                            author of 'The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain' than as the author of
                            'Peveril of the Peak.'"</rs>
                    </p>
                    <p>Such men as the shepherd doubtless still exist, though their conditions may
                        be different; and among the many new editions that are continually cropping
                        up, perhaps "Coelebs" and "Will Chip" may yet appear with their wholesome
                        influences, to the displacement of some of our modern writers and the
                        benefit of the next generation.</p>
                    <p>Her large-heartedness is conspicuously evidenced in her life-long friendship
                        with Mrs Garrick—née Eva Veigel—"La Violetta" of the Viennese ballet. <rs
                            corresp="narrative_elements" ana="allusion">The fact of a staunch
                            Evangelical and a loyal Romanist being able to spend twenty winters
                            together on terms of closest intimacy speaks for itself, though it is
                            quite likely that in these days when the Italian Mission is becoming
                            more and more realised as a proselytising agency, such an unfettered
                            intercourse would be almost impossible, or at any rate
                            impracticable.</rs></p>
                    <p>Hannah More says candidly, "We dispute like a couple of Jesuits"; but it is
                        clear that the love on either side was in no way affected, nor the
                        possibility of compromise entertained.</p>
                    <p>The versatility which shows itself in Hannah More's handwriting is manifested
                        by the readiness with which she devoted the ambitions, which had been
                        fostered under Garrick's guidance, to other interests; and what dramatic
                        powers she possessed were quickly overshadowed by the characteristic
                        enthusiasm with which she threw herself into religious and philanthropic
                        reforms.</p>
                    <p>This divine enthusiasm, however, never waned, as her last book on 'The Spirit
                        of Prayer' clearly shows. It proclaims, in tones as distinct, though less
                        forcible, Carlyle's solemn message to the world—"No prayer, no religion, or
                        at least only a dumb and lamed one! Prayer is and remains always a native
                        and deepest impulse of the soul of man; and, correctly gone about, is of the
                        very highest benefit (nay, one might say indispensability) to every man
                        aiming morally high in this world. Prayer is a turning of one's soul in
                        heroic reverence, in infinite desire and endeavour, towards the Highest, the
                        All Excellent, Omnipotent, Supreme."</p>
                    <p>…"Hannah More is incapable of a literary resurrection," says the Minister of
                        Education…. It may be so, but when the struggle of 1906 is only remembered
                        as one more illustration of the extraordinary bias which early training can
                        give to the mind of a man learned in the Law and the Scriptures, the Church
                        shall be quietly extending her boundaries throughout the world, and
                        educating generations of children whose Imperial instincts shall march side
                        by side with the principles and practices for which Hannah More pleaded more
                        than a hundred years ago.</p>

                        <title>Madame de Staël as Genius in a War of Wills with Napoleon</title>
                        <bibl>A critical synopsis (excerpts and commentary) of "Madame de Staël" in
                            Katie Daffan, <title>
                                <hi rend="italic">Woman in History</hi>
                            </title> 254-69.</bibl>
                    </head>
                    <p> Daffan has a fondness for redundancy, lavishing strings of adjectives in a
                        eulogy that purports to focus on character, particularly the character of
                        brilliant intelligence and insight that saw through the hero Napoleon and
                        withstood his hostility. Assuming there were no other learned women writers
                        of the day, and indicating that women have no sense of justice, Daffan lauds
                        de Staël as exceptional celebrity. Frequently the life is characterized as a
                        spectacle with surprising turns of events, all eyes on the heroine. Madame
                        de Staël's many distinguished friends and visitors add to the theme of
                        recognition. Daffan begins with high praise for genius, which cannot be
                        suppressed: a fitting theme for the enemy whom Napoleon sought to
                        extinguish. </p>
                    <p rend="block">Genius is a combination of native strength and will power. A
                        "genius" is sure to accomplish something, his presence will be felt, and his
                        influence exerted....through years and years which follow his brief
                        existence.</p>
                    <p rend="block">I do not share the opinion of some that the world is full of
                        "unrecognized genius".... When a genius has "common" sense along with his
                        other powers and attributes, he commands recognition from the world at the
                        time in which he lives, and admiration from his biographers. This
                        combination is invincible and brings in its train acuteness, observation,
                        and impressiveness.</p>

                    <p>Daffan recounts the birth of "Madame Anna L. de Staël" in Paris, April 22,
                        1766: "In the inquiring, infidel, though certainly brilliant age, the eve of
                        the French revolution, there appeared a genius...recognized then as now....
                        Up to the time of Madame de Staël letter-writing was the only literary
                        accomplishment attained by women, but to such a degree was it attained, as
                        specimens still extant show, that it was considered a very decided literary
                        accomplishment." </p>

                    <p rend="block">She was the first woman to make a place for herself In the
                        literary world; she stood far ahead of any woman of her time. By her pen,
                        which was always brilliant, though sometimes sarcastic, she pleaded for that
                        which was true and permanent, and condemned the false and unstable. Her
                        charm, manner, and wonderful power in conversation brought to her side many
                        who were first admirers and later sympathizers. </p>
                    <p rend="block">"As a rule conversation as an accomplishment or an art develops
                        in middle life, after the mind is enriched by reading and travel and
                        broadened by experience; but to this pretty general rule Madame de Staël was
                        an exception; as a young girl, even as a child, her conversation was
                        remarkable for command of words and beautiful sentiment. </p>
                    <p rend="block">Napoleon Bonaparte paid few compliments; ...he usually demanded
                        that they be paid to him. But the highest compliment a man ever paid a woman
                        was the one which he, in the zenith of his power, paid to this woman. </p>
                    <p rend="block">He was the monarch of the world ... except the part to be
                        reached by his unconquerable foe, the English navy. His name was on every
                        tongue, ... odes and songs were written to him, princes and kings were his
                        guests when they were not his prisoners, he was dazzling, intoxicating and
                        dazing France.... This woman alone kept an even equilibrium ....and not one
                        time would she do him homage. </p>

                    <p>Daffan repeatedly singles out her heroine as the true patriot and counterpart
                        of the great leader, the only one who could persuade others that "it was
                        selfishness and love of personal power that moved the new hero....She and
                        Bonaparte crossed swords and were avowed antagonists. Both were
                        foreigners...." The woman of "discerning powers" in reading character had
                        known Napoleon long and recognized his "indomitable force and courage" and
                        ambition; he in turn "knew that she understood him; he recognized her power
                        and influence, the magnetic qualities which she exerted upon all who came
                        near her...." Napoleon's emnity and efforts to banish her should be
                        understood as a "compliment."</p>
                    <p rend="block">When he came into power one of his first official acts was to
                        exile her, ... one hundred and twenty miles from Paris under police guard,
                        with instructions "to keep that bird of ill-omen; her appearance bodes
                        mischief." He said of her: "The arrows of Madame de Staël could reach a man
                        if he were seated upon a rainbow." </p>

                    <p>Daffan deems it a coup to make "the greatest man of his time...ill at ease."
                        The biography abruptly turns to the task of telling the subject's life: of
                        this woman with the capacity to bother the emperor, "a few items are very
                        interesting. Her mother, <name type="mother">Madame Neckar</name>, was an
                        unusual and most interesting woman, though severe....She had been a teacher,
                        and her habits of precision and systematic work clung to her; she rarely
                        commended her daughter's work, the nearest approach to approval being: "In
                        time I think you may do very well." </p>
                    <p>"Gibbon the great historian had been in their youth greatly attached to
                        Madame Neckar" and remained an admirer and frequent visitor; "he said she
                        was the most learned women he had ever known and entirely free from
                        pedantry."</p>

                    <p rend="block">The daughter stood in great awe of the mother...; <milestone
                            unit="subject" corresp="life_events" ana="talent"/>when a child she
                        showed literary inclination and wrote dramas, making kings and queens act
                        all of the parts. Her mother discouraged her writing — in fact, forbade it,
                        so it was to her father that she went for sympathy and encouragement, and to
                        whom she was the more deeply attached. </p>

                    <p rend="block">Her father, <name type="father">M. Neckar</name>, was resident
                        minister from Geneva at the court of Versailles, and later minister of
                        finance under Louis XVI. He was a man of integrity, enjoying the esteem and
                        confidence of the French people, and his culture was very broad. During his
                        residence in Paris his home was the resort of philosophers, orators and
                        artists. </p>
                    <p rend="block">The Bourbon throne was tottering because of the vices of the
                        nobles, the impurity of the clergy, the literature of the infidel writers,
                        ..., and the weakness... of Louis. Taxation was heavy, and the people
                        clamored and rebelled against the tyrannical rule, and their children "cried
                        for bread in the streets." </p>
                    <p>Neckar and others still hoped to prevent revolution, and he "loaned the
                        government two million dollars of his private fortune... but it was too
                        late; more than dollars is required when revolution once lives in men's
                        hearts." Although Neckar was exiled for his exposure of corruption and bad
                        fiscal policy in the government, he was repeatedly recalled to rescue the
                        situation: "the people were wild with delight." </p>
                    <p rend="block">The revolution...had gone too far to be prevented....The mob
                        hastened to Versailles, men, women and children, and it could not be
                        appeased. Neckar fled to his country seat at Coppet and remained until his
                        death. </p>

                        <rs corresp="narrative_rhetoric" ana="topos_appearance">was not considered
                            beautiful</rs>; she was impressive and fascinating, astonishing; she
                        understood the art of complimenting, and she was cordial and generous. While
                        a brilliant conversationalist, she drew to herself the thoughts and
                        confidences of others.... She enjoyed the confidence of all of her friends.
                        She was charitable in speech, leaving unkind things unsaid, and this alone
                        won for her the respect of those who knew her. </p>

                    <p rend="block">She was, altogether, a gracious, delightful woman, lending
                        herself to any condition, and ever showing her good breeding by her ready
                        adaptability and consideration of others. She was sought in marriage by many
                        of the best men in Europe. William Pitt, the minister of England, paid her
                        repeated visits and asked her father's permission to pay his addresses to
                        her, as did Count Fersen of Switzerland. Her parents were very exacting in
                        regard to her marriage and were ready to find fault with each suitor in his
                        turn. </p>
                    <p>Here Daffan establishes the desirable qualities of her subject through the
                        prestigious suitors and parents' discrimination of the eligible. The
                        presenter has already tied her subject to historical events and great men
                        while disposing of the issue of beauty and playing up the childhood or
                        youthful promise, the social talent. Daffan follows custom in identifying
                        parental influence, religion, and the careful upbringing; the subject is
                        herself not ambitious, vain, or husband-hunting:</p>

                    <p rend="block">Her mother was much prejudiced against Catholics and exacted a
                        promise from her daughter that she would marry a Protestant. Her father
                        inquired minutely into the private life and family heritage of each, and
                        there were few young men, though many were considered eligible, whose
                        characters could bear the scrutiny. She was certainly not concerned or
                        harassed with affairs of the heart, her attachments were intellectual and no
                        tax upon her affections. </p>

                    <p rend="block"><name type="husband">Baron de Staël-Holstein</name> was Swedish
                        minister to Paris, a nobleman of good standing at court, and a Protestant,
                        so her parents decided that he was a proper suitor. In a mechanical sort of
                        way, realizing that her social position was being enhanced, and glad that
                        her parents approved, she became his wife. Her dowry was two million francs
                        a year ; she became the center of a brilliant, intellectual circle in Paris,
                        the toast of princes, princesses and noblemen. Later she became a good
                        friend to brave Marie Antoinette. </p>

                    <p>Daffan's account highlights the topos of recognition, in this instance
                        friendship with a queen: "The queen received her at court, giving special
                        entertainments in her honor, and invited her to visit at the royal country
                        houses." The friendship was rewarded when "in the dark days of the
                        revolution" (note the trope of darkness) the queen was defended and
                        comforted by Mme. de Staël. This benevolent picture contrasts sharply with
                        the next relationship, her marriage. Daffan is direct: "it was not a happy
                        one." The fault is his character and their incompatibility: "He was
                        extravagant and self-indulgent... he could not rise to the plane upon which
                        she lived and thought. As they "grew very tired of each other," they were
                        soon "separated." </p>

                    <p rend="block">After as before the separation her home was the resort of
                        intellectual Paris. She remained in the city in the midst of the seething
                        revolutionary mass, her advice being constantly sought by Narbonne,
                        Lafayette, Talleyrand and others identified with the awful times. Hers was
                        the home of wit and wisdom. She discussed and wrote about all of the affairs
                        of the day in a manner all her own, and with all of its sparkle and
                        brilliancy her mind was fundamental, practical and far-seeing. </p>
                    <p rend="block">She understood people, she could draw them out and anticipate
                        them; her knowledge of character was wonderful; she could put herself in
                        another's place and feel and know a condition; her idea of justice was clear
                        and true; and how many women — the best women — have any conception of
                        justice? They can condemn a wrong, sustain a right, love their own, and some
                        have toleration; but how many women are just? </p>
                    <p rend="block">Many are merciful, to be sure; they tip the scale of justice in
                        favor of mercy; but well defined justice, is it a feminine virtue? </p>
                    <p>This extensive eulogy to her ability to engage and understand the interests
                        of great men leads to a gratuitous swipe at women in general. This grasp of
                        masculine moral code is confirmed by her writing like and with a man: "She
                        wrote Talleyrand's report on public instruction in 1790, which is said to
                        have been the best exhibit of its kind ever published." Further, she managed
                        the careers and promotions of Narbonne, Talleyrand and other ministers, as
                        she shaped "public opinion." </p>
                    <p rend="block">The entire burden of her thought was "Liberty." She ...never
                        ceased her efforts for the cause of the people, risking her health, often
                        her life, in her efforts to save Robespierre's victims. During his
                        ascendancy she published many powerful defenses advocating liberty, and her
                        work was read everywhere. </p>

                    <p>During <milestone unit="subject" corresp="history" ana="mass_action"/>the
                        Reign of Terror, she "saved the lives of many. She had many miraculous
                        escapes from assassination; upon one occasion her carriage was held eight
                        hours by the assembly, while she waited for the decision of the council."
                        This is an exception in Daffan's narrative, when fabula (or baseline story)
                        and story (or discourse, the way it is told) share the same time or
                        duration; that is, a scene or episode. As in many women's biographies, it is
                        a kind of threatened captivity narrative in which the heroine brings out
                        virtue in one of the most unredeemable men in a lower class mob.</p>
                    <p rend="block">Employed assassins, their arms and bodies covered with blood,
                        their hard cruel faces indicating that they were equal to their beastly
                        work, passed all around her. When the mob attempted to seize her carriage a
                        strong man mounted the box and vigorously defended It. He killed four of the
                        ruffians, beat the others away with the heavy carriage-whip, called a body
                        of armed men to his assistance, and drove her safely through the city. She
                        learned later that it was the notorious Sauterre, the bloodiest, fiercest
                        criminal in Paris, <milestone unit="subject" corresp="history"
                            ana="assassination"/>who afterwards conducted the execution of <name

                    <p>Daffan attempts to explain the good deed on the part of a villain in the
                        drama of <milestone unit="subject" corresp="history" ana="civil_war"/>the
                        French Revolution. "Sauterre had seen M. Neckar distribute corn to the poor
                        in Paris"; Sauterre's "bloodthirstiness" could nevertheless be controlled by
                        "gratitude," an example that no one is entirely evil (and an opportunity to
                        turn the narrative to instructive purpose). </p>
                    <p>At this time, Madame de Staël fled to Geneva, "from the horrors of the
                        commune...to the quiet retreat" with friends. "Hospitality was extended to
                        ...every traveler who asked for shelter...; this home was a refuge to the
                        unhappy ones fleeing from the terrors in Paris. ..." </p>

                    <p rend="block">Madame de Staël never ceased to watch the rapidly growing power
                        of the Corsican; she ...recognized with alarm the extent of his sway over
                        the people; he never rested....It was only a matter of time....before he
                        would extend this power over Europe. No one seemed to understand him as she
                        did...She felt his vanity, utter heartlessness and his total disregard for
                        the real needs of the people... and ...his passion to conquer at any
                        cost....His brothers, Lucien and Joseph, were her good friends and visited
                        her until forbidden by their brother. </p>

                    <p rend="block">A great mass meeting was held in Paris and a bold speech was
                        made on the "rising tyranny." The people were much impressed with it and
                        Bonaparte at once suspected that Madame de Staël had prompted it. He
                        declared through the press that "he did love the republic; that he did love
                        the people," and he openly denounced Madame de Staël. He declared that all
                        who visited her home "were less his friends when they came away than when
                        they entered." She knew to what extent Bonaparte would carry his designs, so
                        she again fled from Paris, fearing imprisonment. </p>
                    <p>The pattern of exile and return becomes a bit blurred in Daffan's account;
                        the theme remains the heroine's talent, goodness, and historical prominence
                        in her tug of war with Napoleon. At the same time, she is a loving nurse of
                        a dying husband, an inspiring focus of a salon, and a suffering exile. She
                        tended "Baron de Staël, who was in his last illness...., giving him every
                        care and attention. After his death she retired to Coppet, which became a
                        resort for interesting, unique people. Artists, writers, philosophers and
                        orators found a home with her, for to be near her was to be electrified."
                        Her "talent" and strong passions made her more sensitive to "the exile and
                        the tyranny to which she was subjected." Drawn to the metropolis, she set up
                        residence "within twenty leagues.... "but when Bonaparte heard that the road
                        to her home was constantly thronged with visitors, men and women from France
                        and other countries, he sent a messenger post haste exiling her forty
                        leagues, giving her only two days' notice." </p>
                    <p>A phase of her "broken-hearted" wanderings led to the Prussian court, where
                        she met recognition of kindly Queen Louise, but "this German hospitality"
                        could hardly substitute for her cultural homeland. "She met Goethe and
                        Schiller and other bright lights then shedding luster in literary circles,
                        but she refused to be comforted and thought constantly of Paris and how she
                        should manage to return." </p>
                    <p rend="block">Her health became impaired, and her son interviewed Bonaparte in
                        regard to his mother's return to her beloved city. The autocratic emperor
                        was unrelenting — he said positively and cruelly: "She would not be six
                        months in Paris before I should be compelled to send her to the temple. * *
                        * I would regret this, for it might injure me in public opinion. She will
                        commit follies, she will have the world about her." </p>
                    <p rend="block">After completing her book "Allemagne," she moved near enough to
                        Paris to receive regularly and to correct proof sheets; for months she
                        worked diligently on this cherished volume. As soon as the ten thousand
                        copies were printed, Napoleon ordered them destroyed, and this order was
                        carried out to the letter. The only reason ever given for the destroying of
                        this work was the fact that she had chronicled nothing in praise of the
                        proud, haughty, egotistical emperor, and he was unwilling for posterity to
                        read a volume written in his day which did not exalt and glorify him. </p>

                    <p rend="block">Humbled..., a sad, broken woman, she retired to Geneva, and here
                        came a chapter in her life entirely new and unexpected — unexpected to her
                        as it was to those who looked on and wondered. </p>
                    <p rend="block"><milestone unit="subject" corresp="life_events" ana="marriage"
                        />She met and very soon married a young officer in the French army, Rocca,
                        of Spanish or Italian extraction. To explain why she did this... would be
                        impossible. Rocca was twenty-five and she forty-five years of age; he was a
                        weak-bodied, dilapidated officer, though accomplished somewhat, and he
                        wielded a strange influence over her.... Her friends discouraged Rocca's
                        attentions, but he replied that "he would love her so much that he would
                        finish by making her marry him." </p>
                    <p>Daffan believes Madame de Staël was weary of exile, starved for love; all her
                        friends including fellow-heroine-of- Revolution Madame Recamier, were
                        exiled. She and Roca could not return to Paris on pain of death, so they and
                        children made the arduous journey to England "through Russia, Austria and
                        Sweden, everywhere being placed under greatest peril and difficulty."
                        Recognition sweetened the journey, however: "Alexander, czar of Russia,
                        offered her courtesies, as did Bernadotte, the general who had become king
                        of Sweden. Toward the end of this journey she became much 'the woman of the
                        hour,' and in England was given an ovation." </p>

                    <p rend="block">The English people took special delight in entertaining her, ...
                        and giving her every opportunity to display her accomplishments and talents.
                        They did this partly from their real appreciation of her, and partly from
                        the satisfaction of honoring one who was so antagonistic to their great
                        enemy. All of Europe knew of the continued exile ... and... watched with
                        interest. </p>

                    <p>Daffan's narrative repeatedly personifies Europe as audience: "Europe looked
                        on now, guessing at the next shift of scene," as Napoleon abdicated and went
                        to Elba and "Madame de Staël returned to her beloved Paris" to preside over
                        "salons" starring "the representative men and women of Russia, England and
                        France. Alexander of Russia and the Duke of Wellington were constant and
                        admiring visitors." </p>
                    <p rend="block">Her friends vied with each other to do her homage, and at this
                        time she was nearer being really happy than she had been since her father's
                        death. She glowed under the light of friendship and drew, as a magnet, all
                        people of her kind unto her. When Napoleon returned from Elba she fled
                        again, fearing him and never believing in him. </p>
                    <p>Although Napoleon invited a reconciliation, she "remained away from Paris
                        until after his final defeat." Napoleon at St. Helena seems, in this
                        account, to deprive his antagonist of purpose, in what ought to be a
                        domestic idyll, reward for a life's principled struggle: "When she no longer
                        had to fight and force her way, somehow life lost zest and animation. She
                        spent the days quietly with Rocca and their children; his attentions and
                        tenderness making life calm and sweet." Daffan's text appears to attempt
                        closure several times in successive paragraphs, seeking the defining
                        accomplishment or attachment, including her writings.</p>
                    <p rend="block">In her last interview with Chateaubriand, when they were going
                        over their interesting lives together, their narrow escapes and wonderful
                        experiences, she told him that she had endured much, had tolerated many
                        annoying, even ill, conditions; had grown weary under the burden of
                        admiration and praise which had so often been hers, that she had tried many
                        times to fancy or believe herself able to love, and to be dependent upon a
                        single personality for happiness, but, as her life was nearing an end, she
                        could look back and realize that the only real love she had ever known in
                        her life was the ardent love which she gave to her father. </p>

                    <p rend="block">She loved God and her country, but alone in her affections stood
                        her estimable father, M. Neckar. She was survived seven months by Rocca. </p>

                        her exile that she embraced literature as a means of rescue from its

                    <p>Agnes Strickland (a writing team that included her sister) entitles her
                        chapter on Elizabeth I "SECOND QUEEN-REGNANT OF ENGLAND AND IRELAND"
                        (Elizabeth's sister Mary being the first). The student of queens cares a
                        great deal about what power the women actually wielded; most were consorts
                        and, far from reigning, found themselves pawns in political chess.
                        Alternatively, most queens encountered conflict between their voluntary
                        liaisons and involuntary matrimony. Strickland's narratives are notable for
                        drawing on contemporary documents.</p>

                    <p rend="block"><milestone unit="subject" corresp="life_events" ana="birth"
                        />Queen Elizabeth first saw the light at Greenwich Palace, the favorite
                        abode of her royal parents, <name type="father">Henry Eighth</name> and
                            <name type="mother">Anne Boleyn</name>. Her birth is thus quaintly but
                        prettily recorded by the contemporary historian, Hall: "On the 7th day of
                        September, being Sunday, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon,
                        the queen was delivered of a fine lady, on which day the duke of Norfolk
                        came home to the christening."</p>
                    <p rend="block">The queen was desirous of nourishing her infant daughter from
                        her own bosom, but Henry, with his characteristic selfishness, forbade it,
                        lest the frequent presence of the little princess in the chamber of her
                        royal mother should be attended with inconvenience to himself. Much of the
                        future greatness of Elizabeth may reasonably be attributed to the judicious
                        training of her sensible and conscientious governess, combined with the
                        salutary adversity, which deprived her of the pernicious pomp and luxury
                        that had surrounded her cradle while she was treated as the heiress of
                        England.</p>
                    <p>Strickland, like most biographers, seeks to account for the subject's
                        character in the parents' principles and early environment. Also like other
                        narrators of biography, Strickland provides a childhood anecdote: "The first
                        public act of Elizabeth's life, was her carrying the chrisome of her infant
                        brother, Edward VI., at the christening solemnity of that prince... when
                        they left the chapel, the train of her little grace, just four years old,
                        was supported by lady Herbert, as, led by the hand of her elder sister, the
                        princess Mary, she walked with mimic dignity, in the returning procession,
                        to the chamber of the dying queen." </p>
                    <p rend="block">All Henry's matrimonial schemes for his children were doomed to
                        remain unfulfilled, and Elizabeth, instead of being sacrificed in her

                        attempt of Lord Seymour, the brother of the Duke of Somerset, the protector,
                        to induce her to marry him, when she was only sixteen years of age.

                        Certainly the celibacy of the sovereign was not in consequence of a want of
                        suitors; <rs corresp="narrative_rhetoric" ana="analogy_ancient_woman"

                            proposals.</rs> Courtenay, Earl of Devonshire, was a second pretender to
                        the possession of her hand; and then followed a proposition that she should
                        unite herself to the king of Sweden. Subsequently, she was successively
                        importuned to wed Philip of Spain, the earl of Arran, the Dukes of Alencon
                        and Anjou, the Archduke Charles a son of the Elector-Palatine, the Duke of
                        Holstein, the Earl of Arundel, Sir William Pickering, and, at last, any
                        body; her parliament promising, in their own name, and that of the people,
                        to serve, honor and obey him faithfully, "whoever he might be." But
                        Elizabeth rejected all their propositions, and asserted and verified in the
                        sequel her intention to die a spinster. For this strange determination,
                        various and contradictory opinions are given. By many writers it is
                        attributed to political objects, not very obvious or intelligible; while
                        others, with more appearance of probability, affirm it to have originated in
                        a conscious corporeal disqualification for the contingencies of matrimony
                        and childbirth.</p>

                    <p>In an extended chain of analogies, Elizabeth is compared to other queens, her
                        elder sister and Mary Queen of Scots in particular. Strickland presumes that
                        Elizabeth is not only physically unsuited to a woman's biological destiny
                        but mentally, with an "unfeminine mind." Mary's reign "ceaseless peril and
                        adversity," but had the opposite of the usual "mollifying" effect; when "the
                        energetic princess... in her turn," came to power, she exercised it with "a
                        far greater extent of hate and cruelty than she herself had ever
                        experienced." This is a standard view of Elizabeth, yet Strickland also
                        admires her resistance to humiliation. "To all the machinations of her
                        enemies to entrap her into some act which might serve as a pretext for her
                        condemnation, she opposed an invincible prudence and discretion." Rather
                        than escape into marriage with the king of Sweden, "she cautiously demanded
                        whether her sister had been made acquainted with it? This inquiry receiving
                        an unsatisfactory reply, she desired that the matter might be formally
                        communicated to Mary, who, though doubtless previously possessed of the
                        knowledge, feigned to thank her for her loyal and dutiful information, and
                        to permit her to decide according to her own inclination." She was
                        diplomatic, too, under religious inquisition, and Strickland quotes a verse
                        enigma that Elizabeth offered "respecting the doctrine of the real
                        presence":</p>

                        of body and mind, though her face may be called pleasing rather than
                        beautiful. She is tall and well made, her complexion fine, though rather
                        sallow." Her bloom must have been prematurely faded by sickness and anxiety,
                        for Elizabeth could not have been more than three and twenty at this
                        period." Her eyes, but above all her hands, which she takes care not to
                        conceal, are of superior beauty. In her knowledge of the Greek and Italian
                        languages, she surpasses the queen, and takes so much pleasure in the
                        latter, that she will converse with Italians in no other tongue. She is
                        proud and dignified in her manners; for, though she is well aware what sort
                        of a mother she had, she is also aware that this mother of hers was united
                        to the king in wedlock, with the sanction of the church and the concurrence
                        of the primate of the realm. The queen, though she hates her most sincerely,
                        yet treats her in public with every outward sign of affection and regard,
                        and never converses with her but on pleasing and agreeable subjects."</p>

                            then only twenty-five years old, succeeded to the throne.</rs> A
                        deputation from the late queen's council arrived at Hatfield to apprise her
                        of the demise of her sister, and to offer their homage to her as their
                        rightful sovereign. Though well prepared for the intelligence, she appeared
                        at first amazed and overpowered at what she heard, and, drawing a deep
                        respiration, she sank upon her knees and exclaimed, "It is the Lord's doing,
                        it is marvellous in our eyes." Eight-and-twenty years afterwards Elizabeth,
                        in a conversation with the envoys of France, spoke of the tears <milestone
                            unit="subject" corresp="narrative_rhetoric" ana="topos_affect"/>which
                        she had shed on the death of her sister Mary, but she is the only person by
                        whom they were ever recorded.</p>
                    <p>Strickland appears to be persuaded by the portraits of Elizabeth as schemer,
                        in presenting these shows of emotion as inventions on the part of the new
                        queen. Compare, in contrast, the genuine affect attributed to the young
                        Queen Victoria upon her succession, in Carey's account (see FS on Queen
                        Victoria). Strickland neverthless admires Elizabeth as a sovereign, and sets
                        out to educate the reader into a more balanced view of her as woman ruler.
                        Elizabeth was "temperate and generous" in dealing with Catholics, without
                        "vindictiveness to her own previous persecutors. Her toleration was
                        general," and yet she enacted various institutional and ritual reforms that
                        ought to have provoked rebellion if handled by a less skillful monarch. Once
                        crowned, "she confirmed all Edward's statutes relating to religion,
                        appointed herself governess of the Church, and abolished the Mass, and
                        restored the Liturgy.... without any resort to violence" by either side. "To
                        complete fully his estimate of the difficulty of this vigorous and dexterous
                        deed the reader must call to mind the years and sex of the perpetrator of
                        it; and then, however distasteful may be the character of Elizabeth as a
                        woman, he will readily admit that, as a ruler, she must have been endowed
                        with many eminently appropriate qualities and talents."</p>
                    <p>Strickland borrows from a historical source one of her first extended
                        episodes: Lord Bacon's account of a courtier's petition for the release of
                        prisoners, according to custom upon a coronation: "....Elizabeth went to the
                        chapel, and in the great chamber one of her courtiers... besought her with a
                        loud voice, 'That now this good time there might be four or five more
                        principal prisoners released; those were the four Evangelists and the
                        Apostle St. Paul, who had been long shut up in an unknown tongue, as it
                        were, in a prison, so as they could not converse with the common people.'
                        The queen answered very gravely, 'That it was first best to inquire of them
                        whether they would be released or no.'" To Strickland, this repartee is a
                        serious example of Elizabeth's deliberate mode of weighing decisions. She
                        "was always careful to learn whether the people 'would, or no.'" It seems as
                        if Strickland misses the joke that the writers of the gospels cannot be
                        consulted as to their wishes. What preoccupies Strickland is Elizabeth's
                        mixed character: Strickland does not want to seem to commend the queen's
                        entire "career, for many were the despotic acts she afterwards committed,"
                        including burdensome "monopolies and patents" that hampered trade. On this
                        matter, Strickland approves of Hume's reproach that the Russian monarch
                        instituted free trade that Elizabeth resisted: "'So much juster notions of
                        commerce were entertained by this barbarian than appear in the conduct of
                        the renowned queen Elizabeth I." To Strickland, the Elizabeth was motivated
                        by "detestable egotism," wishing to avoid the need to petition Parliament
                        for funds, and thus the need to yield to its wishes; "and selfishly,
                        therefore, she resolved to sacrifice the nation's interests...."</p>

                    <p>"In the year 1559 occurred the commencement of Elizabeth's tyrannical
                        intercourse with the unfortunate Mary Queen of Scots. Originally, scarce
                        foundation existed for an animosity which was afterwards, and for so many
                        years, sustained by a sorry feminine spite and vanity." Strickland does hold
                        Mary responsible for openly advertising an intention to challenge
                        Elizabeth's claim to the throne. Mary put "the arms of England...upon all
                        her equipages and liveries.... Elizabeth clearly saw that it was personal to
                        herself, or else, why had it not been perpetrated during the reign of her
                        sister?" This along with "public policy, and religious bias" led Elizabeth
                        to take sides with Scottish Protestants in the "defeat of the Scottish and
                        French Catholics." The ensuing peace treaty commanded Mary "to abstain from
                        wearing the arms of England. But Mary, as long as her husband Francis II.
                        lived, refused to ratify the proceedings of her ambassadors, and though,
                        after his death, she desisted from assuming any longer the arms, she refused
                        to forego her claim to them."</p>
                    <p>This passage on the battling queens curiously leads the Stricklands to
                        pronounce on their method as biographers: "Our purpose is not historical, we
                        merely select for narration such public acts as seem most suited to
                        elucidate the intricate and inconsistent character of this anomalous
                        princess." This is followed by another short paragraph that reveals how much
                        consensus has built up concerning Elizabeth, a biographical corpus that
                        leaves little discretion to the presenter: "The affair of Raleigh and his
                        cloak is universally known, and we shall therefore prefer to relate some
                        incidents connected with her partiality to Leicester, which are not equally
                        generally notorious."</p>

                    <p rend="block">Sir James Melville, the ambassador of Mary at the court of
                        Elizabeth was an observing man, well skilled in the world, and an
                        accomplished courtier. How competent he was for observation the following
                        extracts from his works will show: "The ceremony of creating Lord Robert
                        Dudley Earl of Leicester was performed at Westminster with great solemnity,
                        the queen herself helping to put on his robes, he sitting with his knees
                        before her with great gravity, but she could not refrain from putting her
                        hand in his neck, smilingly tickling him; the French ambassador and I
                        standing by." He subsequently adds, "The queen, my mistress, had instructed
                        me to leave matters of gravity sometimes, and cast in merry purposes, lest
                        otherwise I should be wearied, she being well informed of that queen's
                        natural temper. Therefore, in declaring my observations of the customs of
                        Dutchland, Poland, and Italy, the buskins of the women were not forgot, and
                        what country weed I thought best becoming gentlewomen. The queen said she
                        had clothes of every sort, which every day thereafter, so long as I was
                        there, she changed. <milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_rhetoric"
                            ana="topos_appearance"/>One day she had the English weed, another the
                        French, and another the Italian, and so forth. She asked me, which of them
                        became her best? I answered, in my judgment, the Italian dress; which answer
                        I found pleased her well, for she delighted to show her golden colored hair,
                        wearing a caul and bonnet as they do in Italy. Her hair was more reddish
                        than yellow, and curled, in appearance, naturally. She desired to know of
                        me, what colored hair was reputed best? and whether my queen's hair or hers
                        were best? and which of them two was fairest? I answered, the fairest of
                        them both was not their worst faults. But she was ever earnest with me to
                        declare which of them both was fairest? I said that she was the fairest
                        queen in England, and mine in Scotland; yet she appeared in earnest; I
                        answered that they both were the fairest ladies in their countries, that her
                        majesty was whiter, but my queen was very lovely. She inquired which of them
                        was of higher stature? I said, my queen. Then, said she, she is too high,
                        for I myself am neither too high nor too low."</p>
                    <p>Strickland credits this Elizabethan dialogue of vanity, and adds further

                        her vanity with such whimsical gravity, that it must be transferred to these
                        pages in his own words:—'Throughout her whole reign, queen Elizabeth,
                        pre-eminent as a sovereign, had never been able to forbear the assertion of
                        her claims as a wit and a beauty. When verging to the extremity of life, her
                        mirror presented her with hair too gray, and features too withered to
                        reflect, even in her own opinion, the features of that fairy queen of
                        immortal youth and beauty, in which she had been painted by one of the most
                        charming poets of that poetic age. She avenged herself by discontinuing the
                        consultation of her looking-glass, which no longer flattered her; and
                        exchanged that monitor of the toilet, for the false, favorable, and pleasing
                        reports of the ladies who attended her. This indulgence of vanity brought,
                        as usual, its own punishment. The young females who waited upon her, turned
                        her pretensions into ridicule; and if the report of the times be true,
                        ventured even to personal insult, by misplacing the cosmetics which she used
                        for the repair of her faded charms, sometimes daring to lay on the royal
                        nose the carmine which ought to have embellished the cheeks.'" Clearly it
                        does not occur to Strickland to question the mockery of an aging woman or to
                        sympathize with a woman who loses a source of power in the courtly world,
                        her beauty.</p>
                    <p>This biographer accepts the testimony of an enemy's ambassador and an
                        entertaining historian many generations later. Yet she expresses amazement
                        at the contradictions of Elizabeth's undisputed character, even in citing
                        yet another male judge: "Scarcely can it be believed, that the individual
                        exhibited in forms at once so ridiculous and repulsive, can, under another
                        phase, have extorted from even a Jesuit, the following exalted
                        praise:—'Elizabeth is one of those extraordinary persons, whose very name
                        imprints in one's mind so great an idea, that the noblest descriptions that
                        are given of her are much below it. Never crowned head understood better how
                        to govern, nor made fewer false steps during a long reign. Charles the
                        Fifth's friends could easily reckon his mistakes; but Elizabeth's foes were
                        reduced to invent them for her. Elizabeth's design was to reign, govern, and
                        be mistress; to keep her people in obedience and her neighbors in awe;
                        affecting neither to weaken her subjects, nor to encroach on foreigners, yet
                        never suffering any to lessen that supreme power, which she equally knew how
                        to maintain by policy or by force; for none at that time had more wit,
                        management, and penetration than she. She understood not the art of war; yet
                        knew so well how to breed excellent soldiers, that England had never seen a
                        greater number, or more experienced, than those which existed during her
                        reign. Her conduct in relation to the marriage of herself with the two
                        successive Dukes of Anjou, was in complete accordance with the determination
                        she expressed to Melville, and so many others, "that she was resolved to die
                        a virgin." It is evident that she never had the smallest intention to unite
                        herself to either of them; with regard to the elder duke, the whole
                        negotiation was equally a stratagem both on the part of Catherine and
                        Elizabeth; but with regard to the second, her affections were involved
                        though the object of them was a "very ugly man." The most amusing feature of
                        this grand contention of will between two such illustrious practitioners as
                        the queen-mother of France and the maiden ruler of England is, that each
                        being far too clever to fail, only succeeded by each cheating the other. The
                        purposes of both the arch-deceivers were attained, and both therefore were
                        mutual dupes."</p>
                    <p rend="block">It was observed that after the death of Essex, the people ceased
                        to greet the queen with the demonstrations of rapturous affection with which
                        they had been accustomed to salute her when she appeared in public. They
                        could not forgive the loss of that generous and gallant nobleman, the only
                        popular object of her favor, whom she had cut off in the flower of his days;
                        and now, whenever she was seen, a gloomy silence reigned in the streets
                        through which she passed. These indications of the change in her subjects'
                        feelings towards her are said to have sunk deeply into the mind of the aged
                        queen, and occasioned that depression of spirits which preceded her
                        death.</p>
                    <p>As Strickland adds layers to her collage of Elizabeth's character, the reader
                        feels more that history has moved on than that a story has been narrated.
                        She devotes a short paragraph to the "evil portent," in the queen's eyes, of
                        needing to have her coronation ring removed: over the years it had "grown
                        into her finger," and it had to be "filed off." In the next paragraph,
                        Strickland mentions "the beginning of June," though no year has been
                        specified, no other indication other than Elizabeth's depression and the
                        approach of the next chapter in the book, that the subject's life nears its
                        close. Elizabeth "confided to the French ambassador, Count de Beaumont,
                        'that she was a-weary of life,' and with sighs and tears, alluded to the
                        death of Essex," her obsession.<milestone unit="subject"
                            corresp="life_events" ana="love"/> She said, 'that being aware of the
                        impetuosity of his temper and his ambitious character, she had warned him
                        two years before to content himself with pleasing her, and not to show such
                        insolent contempt..., but to take care not to touch her sceptre, lest she
                        should be compelled to punish him according to the laws of England, and not
                        according to her own.... His neglect of this caution,' she added, 'had
                        caused his ruin.'" Nevertheless, the reign and life of the melancholy
                        survivor carry on in Strickland's volume.</p>

                            ana="topos_loss"/>One of the members of Elizabeth's household gives the
                        following account of the state of the queen's mind, in a letter to a
                        confidential correspondent, in the service of her successor: 'Our queen is
                        troubled with a rheum in her arm, which vexeth her very much, besides the
                        grief she hath conceived for my lord of Essex's death. She sleepeth not so
                        much by day as she used, neither taketh rest by night. Her delight is to sit
                        in the dark, and sometimes with shedding tears, to bewail Essex.'"</p>
                    <p>Strickland almost seems in the position of lady in literal waiting in the
                        court, tracing the fitful moods of the sovereign. At the same time the
                        biographer might be filing through correspondence: from "fits of
                        despondency... we find Elizabeth exhibiting fits of active mirthfulness,
                        especially at the expense of her dwarfish premier, Cecil.... She sometimes
                        so far forgot the dignity of her age and exalted station as to afford him a
                        sort of whimsical encouragement." This "coquetry" is documented in a
                        courtier's letter "to the earl of Shrewsbury" copying "'some verses
                        compounded by Mr. Secretary, who got Hales to frame a ditty to it. The
                        occasion was, I hear, that the young lady Derby, wearing about her neck and
                        in her bosom, a dainty tablet, the queen, espying it, asked, "What fine
                        jewel that was?" Lady Derby was anxious to excuse showing it; but the queen
                        would have it. She opened it, and, finding it to be Mr. Secretary's picture,
                        she snatched it from lady Derby's neck, and tied it upon her own shoe, and
                        walked about with it there. Then she took it from thence, and pinned it on
                        her elbow, and wore it some time there also. When Mr. Secretary Cecil was
                        told of this, he made these verses, and caused Hales to sing them in his
                        apartments. It was told her majesty that Mr. Secretary Cecil had rare music
                        and songs in his chamber. She chose to hear them, and the ditty was sung.'"
                        The gist of the verse was "'that he repines not, though her majesty may
                        please to grace others; for his part, he is content with the favor his
                        picture received.' This incident took place when the royal coquette was in
                        her seventieth year. Strange scenes are occasionally revealed when the
                        mystic curtain that veils the penetralia of kings and queens from vulgar
                        curiosity is, after the lapse of centuries, withdrawn by the minuteness of
                        biographical research. What a delicious subject for an " H. B." caricature
                        would the stately Elizabeth and her pigmy secretary have afforded!"
                        Strickland impersonally ascribes agency to "biographical research" unveiling
                        penetralia, but misses both the vulgar curiosity in her expose of the pranks
                        and entertainments of historical figures, and the element of caricature in
                        her own portrayal of Elizabeth.</p>
                    <p>Strickland adds further scenes of intrigue. Cecil was double dealing as "the
                        creature of the expecting impatient heir" of the aging queen. "One day, a
                        packet, from King James, was delivered to him....Elizabeth's quick eye,
                        doubtless, detected the furtive glance which taught him to recognize that it
                        was a dangerous missive; and she ordered him instantly to open and show the
                        contents of his letters to her." He played on her fear of disease ("one of
                        her weak points"); 'This packet,' said he, ...' has a strange and evil
                        smell. Surely it has not been in contact with infected persons or goods?'
                        ... she hastily ordered Cecil to throw it at a distance, and not to bring it
                        into her presence again till it had been thoroughly fumigated. He, of
                        course, took care to purify it of the evidence of his own guilty deeds.</p>
                    <p rend="block">The next anecdote, however, goes far beyond all our present
                        discovery in optics: "Afterwards, in the melancholy of her sickness, she
                        desired to see a true looking-glass,<milestone unit="subject"
                            corresp="narrative_rhetoric" ana="topos_appearance"/> which in twenty
                        years before she had not seen, but only such a one as on purpose was made to
                        deceive her sight, which true looking-glass being brought her, she presently
                        fell exclaiming at all those flatterers which had so much commended her, and
                        they durst not after come into her presence." Her attendants had doubtless
                        left off painting her, and she happened to see her natural face in the
                        glass.</p>
                    <p rend="block">A fearful complication of complaints ... began to draw visibly

                        to complain of what she felt in the way of personal pain, but continued to
                        talk of progresses and festivities, as though she expected her days to be
                        prolonged through years to come.</p>
                    <p rend="block">All contemporary writers bear witness to the increased dejection
                        of her mind, after visiting her dying kinswoman, the Countess of Nottingham;
                        but the particulars of that visit rest on historical tradition only. It is
                        said that the countess, pressed in conscience on account of her detention of
                        the ring, which Essex had sent to the queen as an appeal to her mercy, could
                        not die in peace until she had revealed the truth to her majesty, and craved
                        her pardon. But Elizabeth, in the transport of mingled grief and fury,
                        shook, or, as others have said, struck the dying penitent in her bed, with
                        these words, "God may forgive you, but I never can!"</p>
                    <p rend="block">The death-bed confession of the countess of Nottingham gave a
                        rude shock to the fast-ebbing sands of the sorrow-stricken queen.</p>
                    <p rend="block">It is almost a fearful task to trace the passage of the mighty
                        Elizabeth through the "dark valley of the shadow of death." Many have been
                        dazzled with the splendor of her life, but few even of her most ardent
                        admirers, would wish their last end might be like hers.</p>
                    <p>Strickland once again quotes at length from the memoir of a contemporary male
                        courtier: Robert Carey, "afterwards earl of Monmouth," who visited the
                        sickroom of "his royal kinswoman": "'I found her in one of her withdrawing
                        chambers, sitting low upon her cushions. She called me to her; I kissed her
                        hand, and told her it was "my chiefest happiness to see her in safety and
                        health, which I hoped might long continue. She took me by the hand, and
                        wrung it hard, and said, 'No, Robin, I am not well,' and then discoursed to
                        me of her indisposition, and that her heart had been sad and heavy for ten
                        or twelve days, and in her discourse she fetched not so few as forty or
                        fifty great sighs. I was grieved... I never saw her fetch a sigh, but when
                        the queen of Scots was beheaded. Then, upon my knowledge, she shed many
                        sighs and tears, manifesting her innocence that she never gave consent to
                        the death of that queen. I used the best words I could to persuade her from
                        this melancholy humor, but I found it was too deeprooted in her heart, and
                        hardly to be removed. This was upon Saturday night, and she gave command
                        that the great closet should be prepared for her to go to chapel the next
                        morning.'" The next day after much suspense she never emerged but lay upon
                        cushions in the private room to hear the service, and remained on the
                        cushions without eating for days.</p>

                    <p rend="block">On the 24th of March, Beaumont made the following report of the
                        state of the departing monarch:—"The queen was given up three days ago; she
                        had lain long in a cold sweat, and had not spoken. A short time previously
                        she said, 'I wish not to live any longer, but desire to die.' Yesterday and
                        the day before she began to rest, and found herself better after, having
                        been greatly relieved by the bursting of a small swelling in the throat. She
                        takes no medicine whatever, and has only kept her bed two days; before this
                        she would on no account suffer it, for fear (as some suppose) of a prophecy
                        that she should die in her bed. She is, moreover, said to be no longer in
                        her right senses; this, however, is a mistake; she has only had some slight
                        wanderings at intervals."</p>
                    <p>Strickland disputes an account of the way the courtiers knew of Elizabeth's
                        approval of James as her successor, and similarly suggests that the vigilant
                        "spies" about court found it difficult to detect the quiet passing of "the
                        spirit of the mighty Elizabeth." Having said prayers, she fell into a final
                        sleep, "and, about three in the morning, it was discovered that she had
                        ceased to breathe." Here another signal is transmitted, this one a legendary
                        secret code but unmistakable what it portended for Britain. "Lady Scrope
                        gave the first intelligence" of Elizabeth's death "by silently dropping a
                        sapphire ring to her brother, who was lurking beneath the windows." This
                        famous "'blue ring' had been confided to Lady Scrope" for this very purpose.
                        "Sir Robert Carey caught the token, fraught with the destiny of the island
                        empire, and departed, at fiery speed, to announce the tidings in
                        Scotland."</p>
                    <p rend="block">This great female sovereign died in the seventieth year of her
                        age, and the forty-fourth of her reign. She was born on the day celebrated
                        as the nativity of the Virgin Mary, and she died, March 24th, on the eve of
                        the festival of the annunciation, called Lady-day. Among the complimentary
                        epitaphs which were composed for her, and hung up in many churches, was one
                        ending with the following couplet:—</p>

                            <p>Mrs. John Herschel's biography about Caroline Herschel, which is
                                based upon her journal and a book of "Recollections" from the years
                                1772 to 1778 that Caroline wrote privately for the Herschel family.
                                This collected memoir also provides much of Caroline Herschel's
                                correspondence. Included is an Introduction by Mrs. John Herschel,
                                as well as a note written by Caroline's neice, Mary Cornwallis
                                Herschel. Full-text edition contains portraits of Caroline and her

                    <p><name ana="CAROLINE_HERSCHEL">Caroline Herschel</name>’s father, <rs
                            corresp="agents" ana="father">Isaac Herschel</rs>, was the son of a
                        landscape-gardener to the King of Saxony. Rather than following in his
                        father’s footsteps Isaac pursued his passion for music, becoming an oboe
                        player in the Royal Hanoverian Band in 1731 at the age of twenty-four. The
                        next year he and <rs corresp="agents" ana="mother">Anna Ilse Moritzen</rs>
                        were married; and her very traditionally-minded family background,
                        especially concerning the role of women, would later have an impact on their
                        daughters. The Herschel’s still-growing family was disrupted in 1743 by the
                            <rs corresp="history" ana="international_war">Battle of Dettingen</rs>,
                        in which Isaac fought, and from which he returned with an acute rheumatism
                        which would weigh on his health for the remaining years of his life. Two
                        years later, however, Caroline Lucretia was born in <rs corresp="places"
                            ana="town">Hanover</rs>—the fourth of six children. </p>

                    <p>All the children, except the eldest daughter Sophia Elizabeth, very early
                        exhibited distinct musical talent, but Caroline's gifts in that direction
                        were almost entirely neglected—writing and reading being, in her mother's
                        estimation, the only necessary accomplishments for a woman. During her
                        father's lifetime he supplied her with occasional lessons on the violin, and
                        to him may be traced the musical and scientific tastes which distinguished
                        his children. When asthma and rheumatism finally necessitated his retirement
                        from the army in 1760, it was his great delight to discuss musical and
                        scientific matters with them; but after his death in 1762 <rs
                            corresp="places" ana="domestic_space">Caroline was entirely relegated to
                            the kitchen, and to the manifold duties which accrue to a servantless
                            household.</rs></p>

                    <p>But Caroline Herschel never thought of herself; she had a "royal instinct for
                        serving others," and to be useful in the narrow sphere of a modest German
                        home was as much a religion to her as was afterwards the loving service
                        which she devoted to her brother in England.</p>

                    <p>Entirely devoid of self-consciousness, with an hereditary spirit of
                        discipline running in her veins, united with an instinctive love of
                        self-sacrifice for the sake of duty, there is a nobility and a "divine
                        enthusiasm" about Caroline Herschel which invests all her deeds with an
                        enduring grandeur which she herself would have sincerely deprecated. </p>

                    <p>For many years the daily routine of cleaning and cooking and knitting went
                        on, <rs corresp="genre_conventions" ana="movement">but at last the relief
                            came, in the shape of a request that was almost a command, from her
                            beloved brother <name>William</name>, that she should go back with him
                            to England, where he had been promoted from Halifax parish church to the
                            post of Organist to the Octagon Chapel at Bath, then recently
                            consecrated. In August 1772, at the age of twenty-seven, Caroline landed
                            on English shores at Harwich.</rs></p>

                    <p>…At the time of her arrival in England she could only read and write, so we
                        may well believe that it was with mingled delight and diffidence that she
                        entered upon her new life at Bath. From being a maid-of-all-work in Hanover
                        to being the coadjutor of a man like <rs corresp="agents" ana="brother"
                            >William Herschel</rs> was indeed a change which our imagination
                        "boggles at"; and had she been a woman of less heroic mould, she might have
                        given herself up to alternate moods of exaltation and despair, without our
                        feeling any reasonable wonder. </p>

                    <p>But Caroline was made of true Teutonic stuff, and this was soon made manifest
                        in her everyday life with the "Hanoverian fiddler" whose scientific
                        discoveries and deductions subsequently electrified the whole civilised
                        world. Seven years his junior, disliking publicity, and a "hausfrau" bred if
                        not born, it is simply amazing to watch the loyalty and devotion with which
                        she followed and smoothed every step of the path which her brother elected
                        to pursue. </p>

                    <p>Strait was the gate and narrow was the way, but no stumbling-block was
                        allowed to interfere, no difficulties discouraged. An innate spirit of
                        obedience enabled her to perform what seem almost like miracles; and the
                        young woman whose acquirements would now be sneered at by many a girl in her
                        teens, was thereby made capable of carrying through schemes, both musical
                        and scientific, which at first sight must have seemed well-nigh impossible,
                        had such a word ever occurred to her in connection with any of her brother's
                        desires or designs. </p>

                    <p>On Sundays she received her weekly housekeeping money, accompanied in early
                        days with due directions as to "debit" and "credit"; and, after six weeks in
                        England, she was trusted to go marketing alone, though her brother
                        Alexander, then in England as well, generally hovered at no great distance,
                        in case she should find any insuperable difficulty in making known her
                        requirements. </p>

                    <p>William was now making a considerable income by concerts, compositions,
                        teaching, and organ-playing, and for a time her attention was principally
                        devoted to making herself of service to him in the musical world. </p>

                    <p>By diligent practising, she made herself equal to performing in oratorios and
                        concerts with no inconsiderable success, the only stipulation which she
                        ventured to make being that, only when William was conducting should she be
                        asked to do so. The marvellous activity of those first ten years may be
                        guessed from the fact that William Herschel was giving from thirty-five to
                        thirty-eight music lessons every week, and that during this time Caroline
                        persevered in her novel duties—practising, performing, and copying scores,
                        just as directed by the beloved brother. She saw and heard nothing save
                        through him; but it is evident that, had self-aggrandisement been ever in
                        her thoughts, she might have made for herself a permanent position in the
                        musical world. <rs corresp="subject_type" ana="performer">For, incredible as
                            it may appear, she was soon counted worthy, even by such stern critics
                            as her own brothers, to take the part of leading treble in oratorios;
                            and the fashionable leaders of Bath society were loud in their praises
                            of her voice and manner.</rs> This admiration, however, was not
                        reciprocated, and, in her blunt German fashion, she denounced the ordinary
                        young ladies as "very little better than idiots." </p>

                    <p>But the poor little prima-donna housekeeper had by no means exhausted her
                        duties when she returned weary and jaded from a long evening of
                        responsibility and exertion in the crowded concert-rooms of Bristol or Bath.
                        Music to William was but a means to an end, and that end was Astronomy.
                        Unconscious of fatigue himself, he seems to have lost all count of time when
                        bent upon solving some of the mighty mysteries of infinite space; and his
                        sister's aid was found invaluable. He had tested his brothers, but had found
                        them wanting; and her obedient zeal in helping forward all his schemes made
                        him realise that here, at last, was one upon whose deftness, adaptability,
                        and strenuous help he could confidently depend. Night after night for eight
                        years they worked together—calculating, measuring, mirror-grinding,
                        examining, writing memoranda,—and not until daylight had chased away the
                        stars did she allow herself to be tired. </p>

                    <p>Never was a man of science so favoured in his assistant. Alexander, though
                        both musical and mechanical, had no perseverance; and, while his 'cello
                        solos were "divine," he lacked the steady fixedness of purpose which would
                        have raised him to the first rank of public performers. It was Caroline,
                        therefore, on whom William relied for help in the construction of tools, for
                        grinding and polishing. "Logarithms made easy" is a book which has yet to be
                        written; but with these also Caroline had to be conversant, as well as with
                        mathematical problems of which her ready brain had to assimilate the
                        working, while her tiny hands dispensed the frugal meals. Sometimes William
                        used laughingly to make her forego part of her dinner if she could not
                        describe the angle of the piece of pudding which she was cutting. She it was
                        who fashioned the pasteboard model of the tube to hold the first large
                        telescope, and her dexterous fingers and eager longing to be of service made
                        her—as, with a touchingly proud modesty, she herself expresses it—"almost as
                        useful as a boy." </p>

                    <p>At one stage of fashioning a reflector it is necessary for the workman to
                        remain for many hours with his hands on the mirror. On one occasion William
                        never stirred for sixteen hours, his sister meanwhile feeding him and
                        reading to him, ready at any minute to obey his slightest wish. At such
                        times as these she read aloud the novels of Sterne and Fielding, and the
                        gorgeous stories of 'The Arabian Nights'; but the fairy tales of science
                        were all their own, and we can fancy that silence would often fall between
                        them as they speculated upon the wonder-lands of the moon with its
                        flame-breathing craters, the mazy labyrinths of the "Milky Way," or the
                        faithful satellites of Saturn. </p>

                    <p>And she never failed him. In all his work she was his veritable "alter ego."
                        In winter nights, when the ink froze upon her pen, she still was by his
                        side—in garden or in garret—helping him to do work which, without her, would
                        have been well-nigh impossible. As in music so in astronomy- her one idea
                        was, "All I am, all I know, I owe to him. I did nothing for my brother but
                        what a well-trained puppy-dog would have done: that is to say, I did what he
                        commanded me. I was a mere tool, which he had the trouble of sharpening."
                        Here, between the lines, we can read the faint, underlying bitterness with
                        which she looked back upon her neglected education. In a note to her nephew
                        (afterwards Sir John Herschel) she says, "My only reason for saying so much
                        of myself is to show with what miserable assistance your father made shift
                        to obtaining the means of exploring the heavens." This was her own
                        self-estimate; ours is far different, and so we are convinced was his also.
                        He might have discovered scores of planets; but, had he not appreciated her
                        skilful help, he would nevertheless have been a contemptible cur. </p>

                    <p>For some years they lived at 7 New King Street, but for the sake of better
                        accommodation in 1779 they removed to No. 19, where, on the 13th of March
                        1781, William discovered the planet Uranus. </p>

                    <p>In spite of the most careful frugality, all this while they had still found
                        it impossible to give up the earnings derived from music; but the time was
                        nigh, even at the door, when organ and oboe should be put aside, and when
                        science, the first love of William Herschel's life, should reign preeminent
                        over the lives of both brother and sister. They made their last public
                        appearance together, on the Whit-Sunday of 1782 at St Margaret's Chapel,
                        Bath,—the anthem, in which Caroline sang, being composed and conducted by
                        William himself. </p>

                    <p>Henceforward, astronomy was their only care and study; though, when her
                        allotted threescore years and ten were long past, Caroline was constantly to
                        be seen at the concerts in Hanover, and the "little old lady" was a familiar
                        figure in the stalls of the opera-house. </p>

                    <p>It was in August 1782 that, through the influence of His Majesty George II.,
                        the Herschels left Bath for Datchet, William having been created
                        Astronomer-Royal, with a salary of £200 per annum. It was a post that
                        brought with it more honour than honoraria; but money with the Herschels had
                        never been plentiful, and the deceitfulness of riches was to them an unknown
                        danger. They cheerfully determined to live upon eggs and bacon, and <rs
                            corresp="subject_type" ana="scientist">set to work upon the construction
                            of that wonderful 40-foot telescope which swept the heavens with such
                            unthought-of results. Recognising her share in its construction with
                            gratitude and astonishment, we see in it a monument of unremitting
                            industry and endurance, such as dwarfs all other astronomical
                            instruments into insignificance, and her woman's wit doubtless supplied
                            suggestions as to ways and means, and expedients which would not have
                            occurred to the less practical mind of her brother</rs>. Hers is not a
                        solitary instance of deliberate self-effacement, but the world will never
                        know how much more than the mere discovery of eight comets was due to the
                        tireless energy and unselfish adaptability of Caroline Herschel….</p>

                    <p>
                        <rs corresp="narrative_elements" ana="episode">One winter's night, when the
                            snow lay a foot deep upon the ground, they were examining stars outside
                            the house. She was hurrying to a little distance from the telescope to
                            make some special observation when she fell heavily upon an unseen
                            butcher's hook, which penetrated deeply into her leg. "Make haste,
                            Caroline," came his voice across the dark whiteness. "I can't, William,
                            I'm hooked," was the feeble answer; and when, with much difficulty, the
                            bleeding limb was extricated, nearly two ounces of flesh had to be left
                            behind. Even then her only thought was of him, and her only comfort amid
                            the pain was that, as clouds were coming up rapidly, she had not
                            materially hindered his night's work.</rs>
                    </p>

                    <p>The Datchet landlady proved herself a failure, and Clay Hill, Windsor, their
                        next abode, was insufferably damp, so that in April 1786 they again had to
                        move themselves and their weighty belongings—no slight consideration—and at
                        last got comfortably settled in Slough. The king now gave to William
                        Herschel a further grant, in order to enable him to prosecute his scientific
                        labours unhampered by pecuniary anxiety, and, as Astronomer-Royal, he was
                        frequently summoned to London. Many of Caroline's observations were now made
                        in solitude. Alone, in the cold star-lit nights, the sweeping of the heavens
                        was not an unmixed pleasure, though the discovery of "the first lady's
                        comet," which so much interested Fanny Burney, must have been a really
                        delightful experience. When she found herself invested with the dignity of a
                        discoverer she surely must have realised, if only for the first time, that
                        she was neither a tool nor a fool. In reply to her modest announcement, we
                        find the famous scientist Alexander Aubert writing—</p>

                            your name, and you deserve such a reward from the Being who has ordered
                            all these things to move as we find them, for your assiduity in the
                            business of Astronomy, and for your love for so celebrated and so
                            deserving a brother."</rs>
                    </p>

                    <p>A salary of £50 per annum was now granted her as "assistant" to the
                        Astronomer- Royal, and in 1787 she received "the first money that ever in
                        all my life I thought I could spend as I liked." </p>

                    <p>We find from another entry in her Diary that she had been accustomed to put
                        down her little personal expenses in her brother's account-book as "for
                        Car."; but that, since leaving Bath, they had never exceeded £8 per annum.
                        Such a statement is too touching in its simple honesty to need comment; but
                        in these days, when the papers think it worth while to discuss the question
                        as to whether £100 per annum is a niggardly dress allowance, we can but
                        admire, and wonder, and adore! </p>

                    <p>The Herschels received at their home many aristocrats and other distinguished
                        persons desiring to see their telescope and to make the acquaintance of the
                        Royal astronomers, among whom were the Prince of Orange and the Princesse de
                        Lamballe. </p>

                    <p>But the happy days of solitude à deux, as the French prettily call it, were
                        now drawing to a close, and it was another woman's hand that was destined
                        for many a long day to darken the happiness of the devoted little sister. </p>

                    <p>On the 8th of May 1788 William Herschel married Mary, only child of James
                        Baldwin, and widow of Mr John Pitt. </p>

                    <p>For sixteen years Caroline had devoted herself to him with an identity of
                        interest and a supreme self-sacrifice, unique even among the histories of
                        unselfish women; and <rs corresp="narrative_elements"

                            <rs corresp="genre_conventions" ana="adversity">we can almost see the
                                tear-dimmed eyes and quivering fingers with which she made the last
                                entry in her Journal of that year, "I gave up my place as
                                housekeeper."</rs>
                        </rs></p>

                    <p>We cannot doubt that expostulations ensued, and that propositions were made
                        that she should continue to live at Collingwood; but she was no longer
                        needed —there lay the sting. Through evil report and good report she had
                        never thought but of him, and now another was to enter into her kingdom.
                        That the bride was gentle and amiable, and that she brought with her a
                        jointure which enabled her husband to experiment still more unfetteredly,
                        did not make the blow any less hard for Caroline to bear; and, in the
                        destruction of all her personal papers from 1788 to 1798, we can see plainly
                        that she thought it best to destroy what in the very anguish of her soul she
                        had written. In after years she learned to love and esteem her
                        sister-in-law, for her own sake as well as for the sake of him whom both
                        loved so dearly. </p>

                    <p>"I gave up my place as housekeeper"—the sorrowful undertone is in every word
                        of the brief entry—but she reserved to herself the right of access at all
                        times to the roof of her brother's house, the observatory, and the workroom.
                        Hither she came daily, returning for her meals to the Spratt ménage. When
                        the family were away she used to go and stay in the house, looking after the
                        interests of him whom she loved so well; but there is a profound melancholy
                        in an entry in her Journal made on one of these occasions, "All came home;
                        and I went to my solitude again." </p>

                    <p>Her "Book of work done" shows no decrease of mental or physical activity, but
                        the contrast between her own small lodging and the happy home-life so near,
                        from which, rightly or wrongly, she felt herself debarred, must often have
                        been very bitter. Within a stone's-throw was all that she most cared for,
                        brother and nephew—the little <name>John Herschel</name>, born in 1792, who
                        in after years inherited the love which she had lavished upon his father,
                        and the genius which enabled him to sweep the southern hemisphere, from his
                        observatory at Feldhausen, with the same earnest assiduity which had
                        characterised his father and his aunt in their northern surveys. </p>

                    <p>Of this South African Expedition she exclaimed in her vigorous Anglo-German,
                            <rs corresp="narrative_elements" ana="speech_subject">"Ja, if I was
                            thirty or forty years younger and could go too! In Gottes Namen!"</rs>
                    </p>

                    <p>"Bills and receipts for my Comets" is the quaint way in which she docketed
                        her memoranda relative to these erratic phenomena, for five of which, at
                        least, she could claim undisputed priority of discovery. The most laborious
                        of her undertakings, however, was a catalogue of all the star-clusters and
                        nebulae observed by her brother, and it was for this that <rs

                        was the outcome of many years of labour, but it was a labour of love, as
                        being the corner-stone in the temple of his fame. </p>

                    <p>The Royal Family showed much attention to the clever Herschels, and there are
                        several entries in her Diary as to days at Frogmore and dinners with the
                        Queen. </p>

                    <p>She was under some anxiety at this time as to her eyes, but the oculist
                        having reassured her, she continued her work with unabated interest. Her
                        constitution must have been extraordinarily good, for though the strain upon
                        it for many years must have been excessive, she never spent a day in bed
                        from 1761 to 1821. She is but another illustration of the truth of Bacon's
                        aphorism—"One of the rewards of philosophy is long life." That her brother
                        should die before her does not seem to have entered into her calculations,
                        and, with a view to her death, she made all arrangements for simplifying
                        matters for her survivors; but the love of living was still strong in
                        Caroline when, <rs corresp="narrative_rhetoric" ana="topos_loss"> in 1822,
                            the tie of more than fifty years was for ever broken, and William
                            Herschel, full of age, wisdom and honour, saw the sun set for the last
                            time on earth, and woke to find himself beyond the stars. It was when
                            stupefied with grief that Caroline took the fatal step of making over
                            herself and all her little capital to the care of her younger brother,
                            Dietrich.</rs> What was at the root of her action we can only guess.
                        Possibly she had some sort of craving to take up once more a place in the
                        home of her childhood, and hoped to bury her sorrow in associations that
                        would be both old and new….</p>

                    <p>"A few books and my sweeper" is the pathetically brief inventory of her
                        possessions at this time; and her only capital, £500—the savings of fifty
                        years of toil—she transferred to Dietrich, thus giving herself no
                        possibility of retracting her determination of leaving England for ever and
                        settling in Hanover with him. Little did she expect that twenty-five years
                        more of life would be given her, in which to chafe against the narrow
                        interests of that small German town. After the width and wisdom which she
                        had enjoyed in "happy England" the monotonous flatness of her life was
                        almost unbearable. Her nephew's advice had been all against her going, and
                        deeply did she regret her hasty action, as the long years passed
                        uneventfully by. But she had "burned her boats," and retreat was impossible.
                        Dietrich, who knew his own inferiority, despised the sister whose
                        perspicacity had not been equal to seeing it also. She made up her mind to
                        endure, thinking that she must soon die; but Death—who claims so many
                        unwilling followers—seemed to have forgotten her, and home-sick, lonely, and
                        sad, she rusted there for another quarter of a century. Her books and
                        telescope she sent back to England shortly after her arrival in Hanover, as
                        she soon had reason to fear that Dietrich's extravagant habits might induce
                        him to sell them after her death….</p>

                    <p>Till 1827 she lived with, and nursed, this fractious and ill-conditioned
                        mortal—of whom she says, "I hardly ever knew a man of his age labouring
                        under more infirmities, nor bearing them with less patience." Then her
                        patience and his impatience alike ended, and he went to his own place….</p>

                    <p>After Dietrich's death she removed to 376 Braunschweiger Strasse, where, with
                        her confidential servant Betty, she lived for fifteen years in an eventide
                        that had in it some faint after-glow of the days that were gone. </p>

                    <p>The sparseness of her belongings seems to have been a source of amusement to
                        her rather than of chagrin, as witness <rs corresp="narrative_elements"

                            in one of her merry moods, she put her foot behind her back, and
                            scratched her ear with it! This astounding acrobatic feat beats the
                            record as far as we are aware! But apparently it created no great
                            surprise, for Sir John Herschel says of her only a year or two earlier,
                            "In the morning she is dull and weary, but as the day advances she gains
                            life, and is quite fresh and funny at 10 P.M., and sings hymns, nay,
                            even dances, to the great delight of all who see her." </rs>
                    </p>

                    <p>In 1846, Alexander von Humboldt conveyed to her the Prussian Gold Medal for
                        Science. It was a tardy recognition from the King of Prussia, but we can
                        fancy that it gave enormous pleasure both to the envoy and the
                        recipient…</p>

                    <p>Within four days of her death, in reply to General Halkett's message that he
                        hoped soon to come and give her a kiss, as he had done on her ninety-seventh
                        birthday, the dear old lady looked up quite saucily and said, "Tell the
                        General that I have not tasted anything since that I liked so well."</p>

                    <p>

                            fortitude never forsook her, but at last she "fell asleep," and on the
                            9th of January 1848 she joined her brother in that land where no sun, no
                            moon appeareth, where no shadow ever falls.</rs>
                    </p>

                    <p>In the old garrison church where she had been baptised ninety-seven years
                        before, the burial service was read over the body of Caroline Lucretia
                        Herschel. Garlands of laurel and cypress covered the coffin, and within it,
                        at her express desire, were buried with her a lock of her brother William's
                        hair, and an old almanac which had belonged to her father.</p>

                        the way of the role-modeling purpose of her story. Instead, it allows the

                    <p>In daguerreotypes, <name corresp="JENNY_LIND">Jenny Lind</name> today strikes
                        us as unexceptional: modestly plain (if not homely), with a serene, even
                        reserved countenance. This unassuming <rs corresp="places" ana="nation"
                            >Swedish</rs> woman was an international <rs corresp="subject_type"
                            ana="performer">opera</rs> sensation in the <rs corresp="history"
                            ana="era">nineteenth century</rs>. Our inability to hear her voice or
                        witness her dramatic power may explain why her fame has faded away.
                        Biographers who wrote tributes to the opera singer during her career
                        describe her performances with manifest emotion, giving us an indication of
                        her captivating presence on the stage. Known as the <name
                            corresp="JENNY_LIND">“Swedish Nightingale,”</name> she began in
                        lower-class obscurity and rose to become recognized by royalty as an
                        indigenous treasure. On concert tours, overwhelming crowds thronged to greet
                        her arrival; and, after a show in London, even <name
                            corresp="QUEEN_VICTORIA">Queen Victoria</name> threw a bouquet down to
                        her from the royal theater-box (Rosen). She remained humble in the midst of
                        celebrity and is esteemed alongside great women of prosopography for her
                        vocal talents as well as her <rs corresp="subject_type" ana="philanthropist"
                            >charitable</rs> example—after retiring professionally, she gave free
                        concerts to raise donations for hospitals and the needy. Rediscovering her
                        through written accounts, along with a wealth of popular-culture materials,
                        including ephemera, cartoons and advertising campaigns, creates a picture of
                        an exceptional figure whose biography intersects with issues of class, the
                        arts in society, and public women.</p>

                    <p>In a biographical tribute written shortly after the singer's death, <name
                            type="presenter">H. S. Holland</name> and <name type="presenter">W. S.
                            Rockstro</name> introduce their honorary subject with a comment about
                        her name which gives us a measure of the impression she made upon the
                        public:</p>
                    <p rend="block">Even the name of 'Jenny Lind' seemed to be inadequate to the
                        occasion. It is a name which English lips caress with affection, having in
                        it the sense and sound of some homely and endearing diminutive. But here,
                        one felt, was something more than affectionate diminutives could express;
                        something more than a delicious singer. . . something of a rare and majestic
                        type, which broke through the ordinary layers which encrust and imprison our
                        average human life. (6)</p>
                    <p>Here, the stature of the great woman seems out of proportion with the
                        public’s terms of intimate affection. Her rise to that stature is all the
                        more remarkable in light of the lack of love or “affectionate diminutives”
                        that she received during her neglected and impoverished childhood.</p>

                            ana="family"/>She was considered illegitimate until age fourteen when
                        her parents were wedded, a second marriage for her mother.
                            <name>Niclas</name>, five years his wife's junior and only aged
                        twenty-two at Jenny's birth, was the unambitious son of a successful
                        lace-manufacturer, who failed in the business when it passed on to himself.
                        He held an unprofitable bookkeeping position and was unable to provide
                        enough income to support his family, but is described in biographies as
                        “good-naturedly weak; much given to music of a free and convivial kind”
                        (Holland and Rockstro 12). While Jenny may have inherited her father's
                        musical inclinations (he was an amateur singer in community festivals), she
                        certainly possessed none of his weakness of character. The single-minded
                        determination she later exhibited in training her voice for opera is a trait
                        to be found in her mother. <name>Anne-Marie</name> came from a respectable
                        family and was well-educated, qualities which enabled her to earn a living
                        as a schoolmistress when <name>Niclas</name> proved incapable of providing
                        for her. In <date>1820</date>, she was running a day-school for girls out of
                        their home, where two of the students also boarded. Occupied with the
                        financial concerns of the household, the mother gave the new baby little
                        welcome and soon placed her daughter in the care of strangers.</p>

                    <p><milestone unit="subject" corresp="life_events" ana="childhood"/>Until
                            <date>1824</date>, Jenny lived in the countryside with a couple, a
                        parish-clerk and organist and his wife. While she was neglected by her
                        parents in early childhood, this was not an entirely unhappy period of her
                        life. Listening to the songs of wild birds, she felt an intense love for the
                        Swedish countryside that she retained even as an accomplished opera
                            singer—<milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_rhetoric"
                            ana="trope_national_spirit"/>a national “instinct…native to the Swedes,”
                        according to biographers. The passion for “the country” had “deep-rooted
                        dominion” over Jenny Lind, and in turn she personified country folk.</p>
                    <p rend="block">She was in close touch with all that belongs to a simple
                        peasantry. She knew the tones of its songs; and the rhythm of its dances;
                        its simplicity, its charm, its pathos—all were hers. Something of its native
                        depth and dignity seemed to have passed into her. (Holland and Rockstro
                        13)</p>
                    <p>During her musical career as the <name corresp="JENNY_LIND">“Swedish
                            Nightingale,”</name> this indigenous quality was cherished by
                        international audiences of all ranks and the combination of homeliness and
                        powerful feelings which she displayed in performance was part of her common
                        appeal.</p>

                    <p>While Jenny's years in the countryside made a lasting impression, they were
                        short-lived. In <date>1824</date>, she was brought back to town and for a
                        period of time, lived with her grandmother in a respectable almshouse for
                        the widows of Stockholm burghers. Here, she received affectionate care and
                        was taught a sense of religion and morality which guided her later charity
                        work. Her grandmother was the first to recognize the small child's musical
                        abilities, overhearing her one day at the piano and thereafter, her natural
                        talent was celebrated by neighboring widows who came to hear her sing.
                        Around <date>1828</date>, her mother's day-school closed and economic
                        constraints once again disrupted Jenny's home-life. She was handed over to
                        the care of a childless couple who had placed an advertisement in the paper
                        for a child to come live with them. The husband was the steward and tenant
                        in the lodge-house of the same almshouse where her grandmother lived, so
                        happily, she was not removed from all familial relations when her mother
                        left Stockholm shortly after to take a governess position. However, in this
                        couple's guardianship, she spent many hours alone and a cat became the
                        audience for her songs. The clear, high voice carried to other ears, and one
                        of the people who heard from the street changed the course of Jenny's
                        life.</p>

                    <p><milestone unit="subject" corresp="narrative_elements" ana="episode"/>The
                        anecdote of her discovery is lovingly retold in nearly all biographies. The
                        version one presenter includes as having come from the singer's recollection
                        and recorded by her son, may be considered relatively authoritative:</p>
                    <p rend="block">Her favourite seat with her cat was in the window of the
                        Steward's rooms. . . and there she sat and sang to it; and the people
                        passing in the street used to hear, and wonder; and amongst others the maid
                        of a <name>Mademoiselle Lundberg</name>, [the principal] dancer at the Royal
                        Opera House; and the maid told her mistress that she had never heard such
                        beautiful singing as this little girl sang to her cat….[When] Mademoiselle
                        Lundberg….heard her sing, she said, <rs corresp="narrative_rhetoric"
                            ana="prophecy">'The child is a genius; you must have her educated for
                            the stage.'</rs> (Holland and Rockstro 17)</p>
                    <p>Included in this version, but not in the one to follow, is the detail that it
                        was a maid who first appreciated the beauty of Jenny's voice before
                        Mademoiselle confirmed the discovery. One can speculate that the maid's
                        absence from other versions is due to the uncomfortable suggestion that a
                        lower-class person might have discerning taste, whether or not acquired in
                        service to an artistic mistress. Regardless of narrative intent, the maid,
                        when she is present in the story of Jenny's discovery, figuratively predicts
                        the appeal the singer had in her career to not only high, but low audiences,
                        as well. The tone of this version of the discovery is strikingly
                        different:</p>
                    <p rend="block">There was once a poor and plain little girl dwelling in a little
                        room, in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. She was a poor little girl indeed
                        then; she was lonely and neglected, and would have been very unhappy,
                        deprived of kindness and care so necessary to a child, if it had not been
                        for a peculiar gift. The little girl had a fine voice, and in her
                        loneliness, in trouble or in sorrow, she consoled herself by singing. In
                        fact, she sung to all she did; at her work, at her play, running or resting,
                        she always sung.</p>
                    <p rend="block">The woman who had her in care went out to work during the day,
                        and used to lock in the little girl, who had nothing to enliven her solitude
                        but the company of a cat. The little girl played with her cat and sung. Once
                        she sat by the open window and stroked her cat and sang, when a lady passed
                        by. She heard the voice, and looked up and saw the little singer. She asked
                        the child several questions, went away, and came back several days later,
                        followed by an old music-master, whose name was <name>Croelius</name>
                        [singing-master at the Royal Theater]. He tried the little girl's musical
                        ear and voice, and was astonished. (Willis 5)</p>
                    <p>When the discernment of Jenny's talent originates with the lady, the story
                        can be placed in a neatly defined package. The woman of a better class
                        provides charitable assistance to one of the less fortunate class: a secure
                        hierarchy—as opposed to the destabilizing potential when a servant assists a
                        poor girl to rise to the level of renown that is recognized by royalty, her
                        name is on the lips of kings and queens. This presenter elects to replace
                        Jenny's name with “(poor) little girl,” and inflects the story with such
                        pathos that ones can see the tendency towards reducing her to “endearing
                        diminutives” which <name>Holland</name> and <name>Rockstro</name> suggest
                        obscured the public's recognition of her rare and intense artistic talent.
                        The maudlin affect veils the slippage between class and status
                        boundaries—what I consider to be the most critically significant part of her
                        biographical story—in the 'once upon a time' of fairy tales.</p>

                        Opera School after he was moved to tears by her voice (Holland and Rockstro
                        18). There, she found her home on the stage. The Royal Theater assumed
                        guardianship of her and she was brought up, educated and received vocal
                        training at the expense of the government. By age ten, she made her first
                        appearance singing and dancing on stage and continued to play children's
                        parts in productions. <milestone unit="subject" corresp="life_events"
                            ana="ordeal"/>Yet at adolescence, her voice changed; it lost the clarity
                        and high tone which had received so much praise. Several years passed before
                        Jenny would gain the chance to debut in the theater of Stockholm; however,
                        with determined study she mastered the new quality of her voice. Such a
                        trial would occur again at the height of the opera singer's career, when she
                        lost her voice and had to learn how to retrain it before she was able to
                        return to performing. <milestone unit="subject" corresp="life_events"
                            ana="vocation"/>Her commitment through this early ordeal signaled that
                        she had taken on singing as work. No longer the little girl who was
                        discovered to have such talent, Jenny Lind had claimed for herself the place
                        of a serious professional artist.</p>

                    <p>On <date>March 7, 1838</date>, audiences made a sensation of her performance
                        as Agathe in <name>Carl Weber's</name>
                        <hi rend="italics">Der Freischütz</hi>. This was the first great role of
                        Jenny's many onstage triumphs and made her a favorite of the Royal Swedish
                        Opera. At age 20, she was accepted as a member of the Royal Swedish Academy
                        of Music and was appointed as a court singer to the royalty of <rs

                            corresp="life_events" ana="ordeal"/>However, her popularity strained her
                        voice; over-exertion left it sounding harsh. Determined again to save her
                        musical powers, she traveled to <rs corresp="places" ana="city">Paris</rs>
                        seeking <name>Manuel García</name>, the famous baritone who became a vocal
                        instructor for the Paris Conservatory, and later, the Royal Academy of Music
                        in London. Before forbidding her to sing a note for three months, he
                        famously told her: <rs corresp="narrative_elements" ana="speech_others">“My
                            dear child, you have no voice. Or, you have had a voice and are just
                            going to lose it”</rs> (Lind-Goldschmidt 13). The period of silence
                        repaired her voice, and nearly a year's tutelage under <name>García</name>
                        saved the opera-singer's career. When Jenny returned to the stage, audiences
                        were not fickle to their one-time favorite, but immediately embraced her
                        again.</p>

                    <p>Not only was she appreciated in performance, but she was also welcomed in
                        literary and artistic circles of society. Though she lacked the beauty and
                        sophistication of the usual prima donna, she evidently blended in easily at
                        refined soirees, as an anecdote about her posing in a recreation of an
                        Italian Baroque painting at a party of fellow-artists suggests:</p>
                    <p rend="block">she appeared, at a Stockholm party, in a tableau-vivant, as
                        Carlo Dolce's St Cecilia [the patron saint of musicians]: and it was said
                        that she looked exceedingly like the picture: and she took special delight
                        in this personal resemblance to the Saint Cecilia; and after her death there
                        was found, among her private stores of little mementoes [<hi rend="italics"
                            >sic</hi>], the rouge-card used at the tableaux, with her own writing on
                        the back to say that it had been given her by Fredrika Bremer as a memorial
                        of that evening. (Holland and Rockstro 85)</p>
                    <p>Along with novelist <name>Fredrika Bremer</name>, Jenny was intimate with
                        many significant figures of literature and music, including <name>Hans
                            Christian Andersen</name>, sculptor <name>Georg Jensen</name>, and
                        composers <name>Mendelssohn</name>, <name>Chopin</name>,
                            <name>Meyerbeer</name>, and <name>A.F. Lindblad, “the Schubert of
                            Sweden”</name> (Holland and Rockstro 4). Although she appeared
                        unsophisticated, the dramatic range of the roles she played mirrored a depth
                        of character which many found to be personally, as well as artistically,
                        engaging. These relationships showed her to be exceptional in several ways:
                        she was of the lower class yet many recognized an inherent sense of
                        refinement about her; she was a popular entertainer yet recognized by
                        cultured members of society as an artist of their own kind; and she was a
                        woman of the Victorian era publicly accepted into the company of men. One
                        biography notes the admiration Jenny's character won amongst serious minds:
                        “Its peculiar force lay in this—that it held enthralled the highest and best
                        minds in Europe. It was the men of genius who recognized in her something
                        akin to themselves” (Holland and Rockstro 4). In her late twenties, she was
                        inducted as the only female member of a student fraternity in <rs
                            corresp="places" ana="city">Göttingen, Germany</rs> called
                        Burschenschaft Hannovera. Amongst the men of this classical German
                        organization she was fondly known as <name corresp="JENNY_LIND">“Little Lady
                            Jenny”</name>—endearing diminutives were attached to her name even as
                        she was distinguished from a commonly recognized form of femininity (Holland
                        and Rockstro 375).</p>

                    <p>For some of those who knew Jenny, esteem for her rare character and intellect
                        developed into romantic interest. Her fine grey eyes and sincere nature
                        captured the heart of Hans Christian Andersen when he met her during a
                        concert tour of Denmark, prompting him to write two of his most famous
                        stories in her honor, <hi rend="italics">The Ugly Duckling</hi> and <hi
                            rend="italics">The Nightingale</hi>, the source of her stage name the
                        “Swedish Nightingale.” She was also an inspiration for
                            <name>Mendelssohn</name> as well as <name>Chopin</name>, both of whom
                        composed operas with her voice in mind. While nineteenth century biographies
                        acknowledge her professional relationships with these two men, a more
                        intimate association was not considered until new biographical information
                        surfaced that could unsettle some revered reputations. Professor
                            <name>Curtis Price</name> (formerly of the Royal Academy of Music in
                        London) claims in a recent biography on Mendelssohn that the married
                        composer was desperately in love with the singer. Price alleges that in
                            <date>1847</date>, Mendelssohn begged her to elope with him and
                        threatened suicide upon her refusal. A few months later, Mendelssohn was, in
                        fact, dead; however, this scandal of musical history remains a speculation
                        since the documents were sealed by an affidavit secured by Lind's husband in
                            <date>1896</date>. Jenny's requited romance with Chopin has been
                        publicly substantiated, though only very recently has it been discussed in
                        biography. Evidence shows that she obtained <name corresp="QUEEN_VICTORIA"
                            >Queen Victoria's</name> approval to marry him <date>1849</date>. The
                        union never occurred because Chopin was fatally ill, but Jenny is said to
                        have sung at his bedside while the composer was dying. <milestone

                    <p>Jenny's American concert tour greatly increased her fame, but her association
                        with <name>P.T. Barnum</name>, who financed the tour, had an unfortunate
                        impact on her reputation. Under the strain of continuous performance, the
                        exhausted singer was considering a transition to retirement, wanting to
                        commit herself to benefit appearances only. Barnum convinced her to make a
                        tour of America by promising that she would earn enough money to pay for her
                        retirement and fund her project of establishing several new schools in
                        Sweden. Counting on the extraordinarily high ticket sales of her tours in
                        Great Britain, the self-titled “Greatest Showman on Earth” introduced the
                        “Swedish Nightingale,” hitherto unknown by American audiences, in
                        advertisements touting her moral purity and social benevolence as much as
                        vocal talent. He began publicizing the tour half a year in advance of her
                        arrival, citing the free benefit concerts she had given as a promotional
                        tool to increase his profits from the 150 shows she was contracted for
                        (after 93 performances, she ended their agreement). While Jenny donated
                        nearly all of the $250,000 she made during the tour, Barnum's commercial
                        exploitation muddied what, for her, was a genuinely altruistic use for her
                        immense celebrity. Critics focused on the spectacle made of and by her in
                        the United States and her charitably intended tour was repeatedly parodied
                        in the press.</p>

                    <p><figure n="JennyHumbug"/>A cartoon by New York engraver <name>William
                            Schaus</name> entitled “Panorama of Humbug” (1850) satirizes the extent
                        of the advertizing campaign that Barnum orchestrated to launch the “Swedish
                        Nightingale” to popularity before she even sang a note for an American
                            audience.<ref target="JENNY_LIND_NOTE_1"/> It shows the public frenzy
                        that greeted her arrival being created by showmen campaigning on the street
                        as Barnum watches from behind a curtain in an inconspicuous corner of the
                        picture. A colossal image of Jenny, nightingale perched in hand, dominates
                        the background and immediately draws our eye to her; an optical effect which
                        ironically mimics the humbuggery being scrutinized. The cartoon shows the
                        friction between her marketability as an eminent figure and her efforts to
                        make philanthropic use of her eminence. At the same time, her hugeness in
                        the picture suggests another reading: that Barnum's puffery as unnecessary
                        because the reputation which earned her such public stature served as its
                        own advertisement.</p>

                    <p><figure n="QueenJenny"/>The approval Barnum generated for the singer before
                        audiences even heard her voice corroborated claims from across the Atlantic
                        that the taste of the American public was guided by popular opinion rather
                        than refined discrimination. A cartoon called “Coronation of Jenny the
                        First—Queen of the Americans” (1850) which appeared in <hi rend="italics"
                            >Punch</hi> is a satirical comment upon the lack of sophistication
                        amongst her American fans.<ref target="JENNY_LIND_NOTE_2"/> Before a raucous
                        and apparently low-classed crowd of people, some prostrate in homage, some
                        whooping and leaping, sits Jenny, being crowned as their popularly elected
                        Queen. Paradoxically, the reference to her royal associations reminds us
                        that the high shared their appreciation of her with the low, challenging the
                        association between lack of taste and lack of status. As though she were
                        Victoria, whom the cartoon rendering immediately calls to mind, Jenny's
                        countenance is as gravely sober as if she were being charged with royal
                        responsibilities. Imaging her as a double for Victoria (even though it was
                        intended to be a parody) encourages us to consider these two women
                        collectively, as both were in highly public positions at the same time as
                        they were figures of feminine virtue for an emerging middle-class
                        ideology.</p>

                    <p>The effect of collecting forms of womanhood is present in another cartoon
                        titled “To Jenny Lind, From Punch,” which makes satire of one of the only
                        public roles that Victorian women could engage in without compromising their
                        femininity: charity work.<ref target="JENNY_LIND_NOTE_3"/> Jenny is shown in
                        the middle of the picture holding a basket of food—an object symbolizing the
                        charitable woman's mission. She stands in a Madonna-like pose, her eyes are
                        downcast, her arm and hand extended to comfort the impoverished crowd of
                        shoeless wretches and mothers bearing infants, who kneel in a circle at her
                        feet. This exaggerated portrait of the ministering angel parodies Jenny's
                        philanthropic activities; yet at the same time, the cartoon's figure for
                        satire runs up against prosopography, which uses the same topos image to
                        present genuinely worthy heroines as models for women's public
                        contributions. Many of the ministering figures found in collected biography
                        shared the mission of charity work and Jenny, who donated concert proceeds
                        to <name corresp="FLORENCE_NIGHTINGALE">Florence Nightingale's</name>

                    <p>Although she continued to give performances to raise money for the needy,
                        Jenny retired from her professional stage career when she completed the
                        concert tour of America in <date>1852</date>. The Goldschmidts settled into
                        the calm of domestic life and raised two sons, <rs corresp="agents"

                        her last charitable performance and during the same year, her vocal talent
                        received one more public acknowledgment when the Prince of Wales appointed
                        her as the first professor of singing at the newly established Royal College
                        of Music. <milestone unit="subject" corresp="life_events" ana="death"/>On

                        century has been largely forgotten today, evidence of her popularity is
