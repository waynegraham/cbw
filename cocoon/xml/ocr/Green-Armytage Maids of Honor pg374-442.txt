creature, full of genius and sensibility"; and when we read her sister's account of her charms, the poet's enthusiasm 
is not to be wondered at. Jane Strickland describes her as "tall and upright, with fine bust and arms, magnificent hair (black as ebony), both silky and abundant, somewhat pale complexion, unless brightened by exercise or excitement, and a graceful, attractive figure." Sisters are, as a rule, very candid critics with regard to the physical characteristics of one another, however 
magnanimous they may be with regard to their intellectual endowments; and the original justified the description, we may be sure, for the portrait is that of a singularly handsome woman. There is a successful self-satisfied air about it, which is not at all surprising when we remember that for many years she was "overwhelmed 
with adulation and praise in whatever circles she appeared."
This impression, however, is evidently only superficial; for when to her outward attractions are added the important 
traits of cheerful endurance, kindliness, reverence, womanliness, and brilliant conversational powers, it is not astonishing to read that "she made many friends and lost none."
MARY  LAMB.
The last illustration of our series is the reputed portrait of Mary Lamb. It has quite a unique interest, as having been painted by William Hazlitt before the days when that "literary eccentric" had merged in literature the undoubted gift for art that he possessed. It is probable that before painting the somewhat ambitions picture of Charles Lamb as a Roman senator (which, his grandson
CONCERNING THE PORTRAITS.

tells us, was the last time that he took a brush in hand), Hazlitt persuaded the "only thoroughly reasonable 
woman" to sit to him. The time, therefore, would be either in, or before, the year 1805, when she was about forty years of age.
The original oil-painting is in the possession of Mr O. Elkin Mathews,— an expert in such matters,— and was purchased by him from a Tottenham dealer, to whom it had come from another dealer who had acquired it from some family friends of the Lambs, on their leaving Edmundton. It was known by them as the portrait of Mrs Mary Lamb, so that its "pedigree" may fairly be considered to be established.
The kindness of Mr Elkin Mathews deserves more than ordinary recognition— he having specially carried up the painting, from his country house at Chorley Wood, to London for reproduction in this volume.
NOTE.
THE STRICKLANDS OF  LIGHT  HAUGH.
After the chapter on Agnes Strickland (based upon universally received biographies) was in the press, information 
reached us from Mr Waller G. Strickland— of
the National Gallery of Ireland— to the effect that Agnes Strickland could not be rightly described as belonging to the Stricklands of Sizergh, and that indeed she herself acknowledged, both verbally and in writing, that she "could not fasten her family on to that of Sizergh."
He informs us that, from his careful investigations, her progenitors came from the Furness district of North Lincolnshire, where they were settled as yeomen, and where they can be traced up to the time of Henry VIII., when they were tenants of the great Abbey of Furness, and shared in its spoils after its dissolution. No connection whatever can be traced between these Stricklands and those of Sizergh.
In seventy years genealogical acumen has made great strides, and we feel sure that the annexed pedigree of Agnes Strickland, now communicated by Mr Strickland,
THE  STRICKLANDS  OF LIGHT HAUGH.        377
— a member of   the  ancient family of Sizergh,— cannot
fail to arrest the attention of all those who take more than a superficial interest in the history of the distinguished 
woman whose work has contributed so much to our knowledge of the Queens of England and Scotland.

ERRATUM.
It has come to my knowledge that the house at Slough 
(mentioned on page 92) was known only, in those days,
1797, as "Herschel's."
Sir John Herschel, Bart., settled in Collingwood in 1841— many years later— and it was there that he completed   his   father's  vast  undertaking, "The  Survey
of the Nebulous Heavens."
