helped to wheel her on her bed or sofa into the next room." The Queen's memorandum adds in her own expressive words, always pathetic from their natural simplicity: "For this purpose he would come instantly when sent for from any part of the house."  As years went on, and he became overwhelmed with work (for his attentions were the same in all the Queen's subsequent confinements), this was often done at much inconvenience to himself; but he ever came with a sweet smile on his face. In short, his care of her was like that of a mother, nor could there have been a kinder, wiser, or more judicious nurse.
The christening of the Princess Royal took place in the Throne Room at Buckingham Palace, on February 10th. The water used for the ceremony was brought from the Jordan. The infant received the names of "Victoria Adelaide Mary Louisa." Shortly before the christening the Prince had an awkward accident: skating in the gardens of the Palace, the ice gave way, and he was suddenly immersed in deep water. The Queen was the only one who gave him efficient help, the other ladies only screaming for assistance. He escaped all ill effects, with the exception of a cold.
There was great rejoicing when, on the following No-vember 9th, 1841, the Queen gave birth to a son. An act of royal clemency inaugurated the auspicious event. All convicts who had behaved well had their punishment com-muted, and those deserving this clemency on board the various hulks had their liberty granted them. There was great happiness in the palace. The Queen writes in her Journal: "To think we have two children now, and one who enjoys the sight already (the Christmas-tree); it is like a dream." And again, in a pretty, maternal way, "Albert brought in dearest little Pussy (Princess Victoria) in such a smart white merino dress, trimmed with blue, which mamma had given her, and a pretty cap, and placed her
Her Majesty the Queen
on my bed, seating himself next to her, and she was very dear and good; and as my precious, invaluable Albert sat there, and our little love between us, I felt quite warm with happiness and love to God." And again, writing to the King of the Belgians: "I wonder very much whom our little one will be like. You will understand how fervent are my prayers, and I am sure everybody's must be, to see him resemble his father in every respect, both in mind and body." And in a later letter she remarks, "We all have our trials and vexations; but if one's home is happy, then the rest is nothing."   What true womanly words !
The christening of the Prince of Wales was a most imposing ceremony. It took place on January 25th, 1842, at St. George's Chapel, Windsor, the chief sponsor being the King of Prussia. He received the names of Albert Edward.
After the ceremony the Queen held a Chapter of the Order of the Garter, when the King of Prussia, as a lineal descendant of George I., was elected a Knight Companion. In the evening there was a grand banquet in St. George's Hall.
In spite of the Queen's domestic happiness, the year 1842 brought troubles with it. There was terrible news from Afghanistan, and though the British arms ultimately conquered, there were fearfully heavy losses, some of the finest of our troops being cut up. There was also war with China, and the condition of things at home was most unsatisfactory, and a growing agitation on account of the corn laws. There were fears of a Chartist rising, and to offer a stimulus to trade the Queen gave a bal masqué at Buckingham Palace, always mentioned as "The Queen's Plantagenet Ball." About a fortnight later a grand ball was given in Her Majesty's Theatre for the benefit of the Spitalfields weavers.   The Queen was present at this.
Two daring attempts to assassinate the young Queen

were made in this year, one by a scoundrel named John Francis, who fired a pistol at her as Her Majesty was driving down Constitution Hill, and the other by a deformed youth, John William Bean, who also levelled his pistol at the Queen, but fortunately it failed to go off. Francis was sen-tenced to death, but the Queen directed a reprieve of the sentence, although, to quote her own words, "she was fully conscious of the encouragement to similar attempts which might follow such leniency." The sentence was commuted to transportation for life, and he was sent to Tasmania. Bean was sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment in Newgate. On both occasions the Queen showed the utmost courage. On the 13th the Queen took her first railway journey, travelling from Slough to Paddington in twenty-five minutes.
Her Majesty also paid her first visit to Scotland in this year—that land afterwards so beloved by her and the Prince Consort—and the enthusiasm of her Scottish subjects pro-duced a marked impression on Her Majesty's mind. The following year the Queen's uncle, the Duke of Sussex, died, and a few days later, on April 21st, another daughter was born to Her Majesty, who afterwards received the names of Alice Maud Mary.
The next important event was the Queen and Prince Consort's visit to the Château d'Eu, near Tréport, the private domain of Louis Philippe. It was the first time an English Sovereign had visited France since the Field of the Cloth of Gold. This visit was a great success, and the Queen, writing from Eu, speaks of her pleasure "at being in the midst of this admirable and truly amiable family, where we are quite at home, and as if we are one of them."
The Queen and her Royal Consort paid other visits this year, first to Drayton Manor, as guests of Sir Robert Peel, and then to the Duke of Devonshire at Chatsworth. On January 29th, 1844, Prince Albert received the news of his
Her Majesty the Queen
father's death, but in this sad trouble the Queen's sympathy was a great alleviation. "I have been with the Queen," writes Lady Lyttelton, in a letter at this time, "a good deal altogether. She is very affecting in her grief, which is in truth all on the Prince's account, and every time she looks at him her eyes fill afresh. He has suffered dreadfully, being very fond of his father; and his separation from him, and the suddenness of the event, and his having expected to see him soon, all contributed to make it worse." Later on, duty demanded the Prince's presence at Coburg; and this separation, brief as it was—only a fortnight—was extremely painful to the Queen, as since their marriage they had not been apart for a day.
The great Court event of the year was the visit of Nicholas, the Czar of Russia, the "hard, cold, cruel, hand-some and imposing Nicholas." There were splendid festivities at Windsor and Buckingham Palace.
On August 6th the Queen gave birth to her second son, Alfred Ernest Albert, afterwards Duke of Edinburgh; and later on, in September, she and the Princes, with the Princess Royal, paid another visit to Scotland, Blair Castle having been placed at their disposal by Lord Glenlyon, afterwards the Duke of Athole; and on October 8th Louis Philippe, King of the French, arrived at Windsor Castle.
Two more daughters, Helena and Louise, and a third son, Prince Arthur, were born to the Royal couple during the next few years; and still later on two other children, Prince Leopold and Princess Beatrice, completed the family.
The education of their children had been the Queen's and the Prince Consort's earliest care. Her Majesty writes to Lord Melbourne in 1842, "We are much occupied in considering the future management of our nursery establish-ment, and naturally find considerable difficulties in it. . . . Stockmar   says—and   very  justly—that   our   occupations
Married Life
49
prevent us from managing these affairs as much our own selves as other parents can, and therefore we must have some one in whom to place implicit confidence."
Such a person was found in Lady Lyttelton, who for eight years filled the office of governess to the Royal children, and it was a sad day for her young charges when she resigned her office.
The Queen's method of education for her children was excellent: they were brought up with the utmost simplicity, and the strictest discipline was exercised in the Royal nurseries.
That charming book, "The Private Life of the Queen," by one of Her Majesty's servants, tells us that the Queen "always made time in her busy life to bathe with her own hands the last new baby."
The children were never brought into contact with Court life. "Many of the Queen's ladies scarcely knew the Royal children, save by sight, and by catching brief glimpses of them as they walked in the gardens with their parents, or sometimes came to dessert after dinner. The most care-fully selected governesses and professors taught the children English, French, German, and the arts."
And again: "The religious training of the Royal children was entirely mapped out by the Queen, who herself drew up a memorandum, which if it were given to the world in full, would prove of inestimable benefit to all parents, so kindly, so truly sympathetic, so earnest and womanly is it. Touch-ing the Princess Royal in particular, she says, 'I am quite clear that she should be taught to have great reverence for God and for religion, and that she should have the feeling of devotion and love which our heavenly Father encourages His earthly children to have for Him, and not one of fear and trembling.'
"The note touching the religious training of the Prince of Wales was even more decided: 'The law prescribes the
4

Her Majesty the Queen
belief of the Church of England shall be the faith of the members of the Royal Family, and in this faith the Prince of Wales must unquestioningly be trained."
In all these matters the Prince Consort was her truest adviser and counsellor; and as years passed and the weight of government and public cares pressed more heavily on the Queen, so did she lean more on that strong arm and bright intellect, and the patient, cheerful, considerate spirit, "which toil and trial and disappointment seemed only to ripen into fuller beauty." In reading the records of the Royal lives one is struck by the Prince Consort's application to work and his unflagging and incessant industry. As Sir Theodore Martin tells us, in his exhaustive "Life of the Prince," "Every enterprise of national importance claimed his attention; and in all things that concerned the welfare of the State, at home or abroad, his accurate and varied knowledge, and great political sagacity, made him looked to as an authority by all our leading statesmen." And in another passage full of interest, he tells us his methods of work. "Like most men who have done great things in the world, the Prince got to his work early, and had made good progress with it before other people were stirring. Summer or winter he rose as a rule at seven, dressed and went to his sitting-room, where in winter a fire was burning, and a green German lamp ready lit. He read and answered letters, never allowing his vast correspondence to fall into arrears; or prepared for Her Majesty's consideration drafts of answers to her Ministers on any matters of importance. ... He kept up this habit to the close of his life, and his last memorandum of this description he brought to the Queen on December 1st, 1861, at 8 a.m., having risen to write it, ill and suffering as he was, saying as he gave it, "Ich bin so schwach, ich habe kaum die Feder halten können" (I am so weak, I have scarcely been able to hold the pen).

During all these years of stirring life there were many events of the deepest interest to the Queen and her Royal Consort. In 1845 she accompanied him to Germany.
The previous fortnight had been spent at their new island home, Osborne, which had been purchased in the preceding year—a marine residence comprising grounds of upwards of eight hundred acres, and well stocked with noble timber. A new mansion was subsequently built. "The house," the Queen writes, "was planned by the Prince, and his wishes admirably carried out by the late Mr. Thomas Cubitt. . . . In laying out the grounds and his farming operations," Her Majesty adds, "the Prince was ably seconded by Mr. Toward, our land steward for twenty-six years." In truth, the Prince might have said, as Scott did of Abbotsford: "My heart clings to the place I have erected. There is scarce a tree in it that does not owe its existence to me." The property now extends to 2300 acres.
We read pleasant accounts of the house-warming when the Queen and her household first took up their residence there, when the Queen's and Prince's healths were drank; and at the Prince's suggestion an appropriate Psalm was sung, translated from Luther's "God bless our going out, nor less our coming in, and make them sure."
The visit to Coburg with her beloved husband gave the Queen intense pleasure. Rosenau was the place where he had been born and "spent the happiest years of his boyhood."
"How happy, how joyful," she writes in her journal, "we were, on awaking, to feel ourselves here, at the dear Rosenau, my Albert's birthplace, the place he most loves! He is so, so happy to be here with me. It is like a beautiful dream."
September 1848 was memorable to the Royal couple, for it was their first visit to their future Highland home. We are told in the "Life of the Prince Consort" that Sir James Clark's attention had been called to the fine air and other
52               Her Majesty the Queen
attractions of this part of Deeside as a summer and autumn residence. Having satisfied himself on these points, he had urged the Queen and Prince to acquire the lease of the Balmoral estates from the Earl of Aberdeen. Writing to the Dowager Duchess of Coburg, the Prince says of this
visit:—
"We have withdrawn for a short time into a complete mountain solitude, where one rarely sees a human face, where the snow already covers the mountain tops, and the wild deer come creeping stealthily round the house. Scenes which, in Her Majesty's own words, seem to breathe freedom and peace, and to make one forget the world and its sad turmoil."
The following year, 1849, was still more memorable, for the Great Exhibition was first projected by the Prince Consort. The germ of this and all Industrial Exhibitions of our own age was contained in the celebrated Frankfort Fairs of the sixteenth century. The Prince propounded his views to four most active members of the Society of Arts; and after taking counsel with the Government, a fitting area was found in Hyde Park. In this year, too, the Queen and the Prince paid their first visit to Ireland, and received a most enthu-siastic welcome from the warm-hearted people; "the effect produced by the visit was most salutary," wrote Sir James Clark, who formed one of the Royal suite. The year closed sadly, however, with the death of the Queen Dowager, the good, amiable Queen Adelaide, at Bentley Priory.
The opening of the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park was an eventful day in the Queen's life. She wrote a graphic account of the ceremony in her diary. Her thankfulness and joy are, as usual, touchingly expressed. "God bless my dearest Albert! God bless my dearest country, which has shown itself so great to-day! One felt so grateful to the great God who seems to pervade all and bless all! The only event it in the slightest degree reminded me of was the

coronation, but this day's festival was a thousand times superior. In fact, it is unique, and can bear no comparison, from its peculiarity, beauty, and combination of such different and striking objects." And in another passage: "Albert is immortalised;" here is the wifely key-note of the whole; and in a letter to Lady Lyttelton she writes, "...that great and glorious 1st of May. The proudest and happiest day of—as you truly call it—my happy life. . . . To see this great conception of my beloved husband's mind, which is always labouring for the good of others, to see this great thought and work crowned with triumphant success, in spite of difficulties and opposition of every imaginable kind, and of every effort to which jealousy and calumny could resort to cause its failure, has been an immense happiness to us both."
Thackeray's "May-Day Ode" expressed the universal feeling:—
"But yesterday a naked sod :
The dandies sneered from Rotten Row,
And cantered o'er it to and fro;
And see, 'tis done!
As though 'twere by a wizard's rod,
A blazing arch of lucid glass
Leaps like a fountain from the grass
To meet the sun."
We are told that this beautiful poem, cut from the Times, was preserved by the Prince, as it well deserved to be, among his private records of the Exhibition.
The following year the Duke of Wellington died, much mourned by Her Majesty; for in some measure "he had held towards her the triple capacity of father, hero, and friend."
Clouds were gathering on the horizon, and troublous times coming for England and England's Queen. On February 28th, 1854, Her Majesty signed a formal declara-tion of war with Russia; and for the next two years we are
Her Majesty the Queen
told that her life was spent in consuming anxiety. Alma, Inkermann, Balaclava, and the charge of the Light Brigade —the blood of heroes shed freely—and the cry of widows and orphans ascending to heaven.
The Queen suffered so keenly for her soldiers, that one of the Royal children said to Lord Cardigan, when he came to Windsor, "You must hurry back to Sebastopol and take it, else it will kill mamma." It was after the Crimean War, with its dearly bought victories, that Her Majesty first distributed that much coveted distinction, the Victoria Cross or Cross of Valour; and we are also told that it was owing to the Queen's efforts that the beautiful military hospital of Netley was built. It was at this time the Queen conferred on her husband the title of Prince Consort.
In 1857 her Majesty's last child, the Princess Beatrice, was born; and soon after followed the betrothal of the Princess Royal, then only fifteen years old, to Prince Frederick William of Prussia, heir to the throne. The two years that intervened between the engagement and marriage were saddened by the awful tidings of the Indian Mutiny.  "We are tortured by the events in India," wrote the Prince to his faithful Stockmar, "which are truly frightful!" And again the Queen's womanly sympathies were strongly excited by the terrible details of Cawnpore.
On the Princess Royal's wedding day the Queen wrote in her Journal: "The second most eventful day of my life as regards feelings. I felt as though I was being married over again myself, only much more nervous, for I had not the blessed feeling of giving myself for life to him whom I loved and worshipped then and ever." The parting from their beloved child was keenly felt by the Queen and Prince Consort. The young Princess soon won golden opinions in her new home; and her father's remark, "that the Princess Royal had a man's head and a child's heart," was soon  confirmed by  the reports  from  Berlin.  The
