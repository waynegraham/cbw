confidant, a creature even more abject than himself—his
friend and tool, the Canon Loyseleur. This man went to Joan in disguise, and told her that he, too, was a prisoner, a loyal subject of King Charles, and a native of her own province. The guards left them together, and she, poor child! being glad to see a friendly face, talked to him with a trustfulness that might have touched even such a heart as his. The bishop listened in an adjoining
room, and stationed two scribes there to report Joan's words; but the men were too honest for such work, and refused to do it. To gain her fuller confidence,
Loyseleur made known to her that he was a priest, and heard her in confession. He also gave her counsel how to answer her judges—bad and crooked counsel, of which she availed herself little, but still enough for us to trace here and there the influence of an evil mind over hers.
On Tuesday, February 20th, she was summoned to appear next day before her judges. Having heard and seen what they were, she demanded that an equal number of assessors of the French party should be associated
with them. She also entreated the Bishop of Beauvais to let her hear religious service. The prayer was denied.
Joan appeared before them a youthful, girlish creature in her masculine dress. The dress was all black, relieved only by the pale prison-worn face, from which the dark eyes looked out fearlessly.
The bishop began by briefly stating the crimes she was accused of, and explaining to her how he came to be her judge. He then exhorted her, "with gentleness and charity," to answer truly all questions put to her. From the first moment of the trial she was on her
92          Heroines Every Child Should Know
guard. She felt her judges' falsehood and malevolence in the very air around her.
The Gospels were brought, and she was ordered to swear upon them that she would speak the truth. She hesitated.
"I do not know what questions you may put to me," she said. "Perhaps you will ask me things I cannot tell you."
''Will you swear," insisted Cauchon, "to speak the truth about whatever you are asked concerning the faith, and whatever you know?" She answered that she would willingly speak of her parents, and of all her own actions since she had left Domremy.
Jean Beaupere took up the examination. His first question was, when she had last eaten and drunk. It was the season of Lent; if she had taken food as usual, she might be accused of contempt for the Church; if she had fasted, she gave colour to a theory of Beaupere's, that her visions were induced chiefly by physical causes. She told him she had fasted since noon the day before. He inquired at what hour she had last heard the voice.
"I heard it yesterday and to-day," she said. "I was asleep, and it woke me.... I do not know whether it was in my room, but it was in the castle.... I thanked it, sitting up in my bed, with clasped hands, and implored its counsel.... I had asked God to teach me by its counsel how to answer."
"And what did the voice say?"
"It told me to answer boldly, and God would help me." Here she turned to the bishop. "You say that you are my judge. Take heed what you do, for indeed I am sent by God, and you are putting yourself in great peril."

Beaupere asked her if the voice never varied in its counsel.
''No," she said; "it has never contradicted itself. Last night again it bade me answer boldly."
Her dress, her banner and pennon, were inquired about. Had not the Knights, her companions, their pennons made after the pattern of hers? Had she not told them that such pennons would be lucky? To this she answered:
"I said to my men— 'Go in boldly among the English!'—and I went myself."
"Did you not tell them to carry their pennons boldly, and they would have good luck?"
"I indeed told them what came to pass, and will come to pass again."
Had she not ordered pictures or images of herself to be made? No, nor had she ever seen any image in her likeness. She had seen a picture of herself at Arras. She was represented kneeling on one knee, and presenting letters to the King.
Did she know that those of her party had caused masses and prayers to be said in her honour?
"I know nothing of it," she answered, "and if they did so, it was not by my command. Nevertheless, if they prayed for me, I think they did no wrong."
"Do those of your party believe firmly that you are sent by God?"
"I do not know. I leave that to their consciences. But if they do not believe it, I am none the less sent by Him."
"Do you think them right in believing it ?"
"If they believe that I am sent by God, they are not deceived."

"Did you understand the feelings of those who kissed your feet, your hands and your garments?"
"Many were glad to see me. I let them kiss my hands as little as possible; but the poor people came to me gladly, because I did them no unkindness, but helped them as much as I could."
"Did not the women touch their rings with the ring you wore?"
"Many women touched my hands and my rings, but I do not know why they did so."
For more than three months her trial went on. But her fate was settled now. The Inquisition had no pardon for her. The judges left her, a few daring to be sorry for the brave creature, but most of them openly and indecently glad. In the courtyard they found a number of English waiting for news, among them the Earl of Warwick.
"Farewell, farewell!" cried the bishop, as he passed him; "be of good cheer—it is done!"
Her guilt was proved; let her be given over to the secular power; but first let her be charitably exhorted for her soul's welfare, and warned that she had nothing more to hope for in this world.
The bishop ordered a citation to be drawn up, summoning 
Joan to appear next morning in the Old Market Place of Rouen, to receive her final sentence. She did not hear her doom that night (May 30, 1431), but the grave faces and grave words of the monks showed her the dreadful reality, and for a little while youth and womanhood and human weakness had their own way with her. She wept piteously.
"Alas," she cried, "will they treat me so horribly and
Joan of Arc
95
cruelly? Must my body be consumed to-day and turned to ashes? Ah! I would sooner seven times be beheaded than be burnt! Oh, I appeal to God, the great Judge, against the wrong and injustice done to me!"
While she was thus lamenting Cauchon came in, with Pierre Maurice, and two or three others. Seeing him, she cried:
"Bishop, I die by you!"
Maurice looked kindly at her as he went, and she said to him:
"Master Pierre, where shall I be to-night?"
"Have you not a good hope in God?" he asked.
"Ah, yes, and by God's grace, I shall be in Paradise."
She received the sacrament with tears, and with deep penitence and devotion. Thenceforth her faith was unshaken, and she failed no more.
Next morning at nine o'clock she left the prison, clothed now in a woman's long gown, and wearing a mitre, inscribed
with the words, Heretic, Relapsed, Apostate, Idolatress. A cart was waiting for her, and she got into it, accompanied by Brother Martin and the usher Mas-sieu. A guard of about eight hundred soldiers surrounded
her to keep off the crowd, but suddenly there rushed through their ranks a haggard and miserable figure. It was Nicolaus Loyseleur, who, seized by late and vain remorse, had come to ask forgiveness of her whom he had betrayed. But before he could reach her, the soldiers drove him back, and Joan probably neither saw nor heard him, for she was weeping and praying, her head bowed upon her hands.
When she looked up, she saw beyond the soldiers a dense throng of people, most of them grieving for her,
96
Heroines Every Child Should Know
many of them lamenting that this thing should be done in their city.
"O Rouen, Rouen!" she cried, "is it here that I must die?"
At last she reached the Old Market Place, a very large space, where had been raised three scaffolds: one for the Bishop of Beauvais and his colleagues, and for all the prelates and nobles who desired to see the show; another for Joan and some priests and officials; the third, also for Joan—a pile of stone and plaster, raised high above the heads of the crowd, and heaped with faggots. In front of it was a tablet bearing this inscription:
Joan, who has called herself The Maid—liar, pernicious,
deceiver of the people, sorceress, superstitious, blasphemer of God, presumptuous, disbeliever of the faith of Christ, boaster, idolatress, dissolute, invoker of devils, apostate, schismatic, heretic.
Master Nicolas Midi, a famous doctor from Paris, preached Joan's last sermon, on the text, "If one member
suffer, all the members suffer with it."
At its close, he addressed her:
"Joan, go in peace! The Church can no longer defend you; it gives you up to the secular power."
Then the bishop spoke to her. He did not read the form of abjuration, as had been advised, for she would have boldly disavowed it, and would so have spoilt a scheme he had concocted. But he admonished her to think of her salvation, to remember her misdeeds, and repent of them. Finally, after the usual inquisitorial form, he declared her cut off from the Church, and delivered over to secular justice.
She needed no exhortation to prayer and penitence. For a while she seemed to forget the gazing crowd and
Joan of Arc

the cruel judges. She knelt and prayed fervently—prayed
aloud with such passionate pathos, that all who heard her were moved to tears. Even Cauchon wept. Even the Cardinal was touched. She forgave her enemies;
she remembered the King, who had forgotten her; she asked pardon of all, imploring all to pray for her, and especially entreating the priests to say a mass for her soul. Presently she asked for a cross. An English soldier broke a stick in two and made a rough cross, which he gave her. She kissed it and put it in her bosom, weeping, calling upon God and the saints.
But the men-at-arms were growing impatient. "Come, you priests!" shouted one of them, "are you going to make us dine here?"
The bailiff of Rouen, as representing the secular power, should have now pronounced sentenced of death, but he seemed afraid of delaying the soldiers, two of whom came up and seized Joan.
"Take her! take her!" he said, hurriedly, and he bade the executioner "do his duty." The bishop's trial had, after all, an illegal and informal ending.
The soldiers dragged Joan to the pile, and as she climbed it, some of her judges left their platform and rushed away, fearing to behold what they had helped to bring about. She was fastened to the stake, high up, that the flames might gain slowly upon her, and that the executioner might not be able to reach her and mercifully
shorten her agony.
"Ah, Rouen!" she cried again, as she looked over the city, bright in the May sunshine—"Ah, Rouen, Rouen! I fear thou wilt have to suffer for my death!"
The executioner set fire to the pile. The confessor was by Joan's side, praying with her, comforting her so
98
Heroines Every Child Should Know
earnestly, that he took no notice of the ascending flames It was she who saw them and bade him leave her.
"But hold up the cross," she said, "that I may see it."
Now Cauchon went to the foot of the pile, hoping perhaps that his victim might say some word of recantation.
Perceiving him there, she cried aloud:
"Bishop, I die by you!"
And now the flames reached her, and she shrank from them in terror, calling for water—holy water! But as they rose and rose and wrapped her round, she seemed to draw strength from their awful contact. She still spoke. Brother Martin, standing in the heat and glare of the fire, holding the cross aloft for her comfort, heard her dying words:
"Jesus! Jesus! Mary! My voices! My voices!"
Did she hear them, those voices that had said, "Fret not thyself because of thy martyrdom; thou shalt come at last to the Kingdom of Paradise"?
"Yes," she said, "my voices were from God! My voices have not deceived me!" Then, uttering one great cry—"Jesus!" she drooped her head upon her breast, and died.
The common folk soon added their tale of signs and wonders to the simple and terrible truth. An English soldier, who greatly hated the Maid, had sworn to bring a faggot to her burning, and he threw it on the pile just as she gave that last cry. Suddenly he fell senseless to the earth, and when he recovered, he told how at that moment he had looked up, and had seen a white dove fly heavenward out of the fire. Others declared that they had seen the word Jesus—her dying word—written in the flames. The executioner rushed to a confessor.

crying that he feared to be damned, for he had burned a holy woman. But her heart would not burn, he told the priest; the rest of her body he had found consumed to ashes, but her heart was left whole and unharmed.
Many, not of the populace, were moved by her death to recognise what she had been in life.
"I would that my soul were where I believe the soul of that woman is!" exclaimed Jean Alespee, one of the judges.
"We are all lost; we have burnt a saint!" cried Tressart,
a secretary of the King of England. Winchester—determined
that, though she might be called a saint, there should be no relics of her—had her ashes carefully
collected and thrown into the Seine.
The tidings of her death went speedily through France. They found Charles in his southern retirement, and nowise disturbed the ease of mind and body that was more to him than honour. They reached Domremy, and broke the heart of Joan's stern, loving father. Isabelle Romee lived to see her child's memory righted and her prophecies fulfilled.
In June, 1455, Pope Calixtus, named a commission to inquire into the trial of Joan of Arc.
Joan's aged mother came before them, supported by her sons, and followed by a great procession of nobles, scholars, and honourable ladies. She presented the petition she had made to the Pope, and the letter whereby he granted it, and the commissioners took her aside, heard her testimony, and promised to do her justice
And now the dead heroine was confronted with her dead judges, to their shame and her enduring honour. Messengers were sent into her country to hear the story of her innocent childhood and pure, unselfish youth. Through her whole life went the inquiry, gathering testi-
100        Heroines Every Child Should Know
mony from people of all ranks. The peasants whom she had loved and tended in her early girlhood, the men who had fought by her side, the women who had known and honoured her, the officers of the trial, and many who had watched her sufferings and beheld her death—all were called to speak for her now. They testified to her goodness, her purity, her single-hearted love for France, her piety, her boldness in war, and her good sense in counsel. All were for her—not one voice was raised against her. Rouen, the place of her martyrdom, became
the place of her triumph.
The judges pronounced the whole trial to be polluted by wrong and calumny, and therefore null and void; finally, they proclaimed that neither Joan nor any of her kindred had incurred any blot of infamy, and freed them from every shadow of disgrace.
By order of the tribunal, this new verdict was read publicly
in all the cities of France, and first at Rouen, and in the Old Market Place, where she had been cruelly burnt. This was done with great solemnity; processions were made, sermons were preached, and on the site of her martyrdom a stone cross was soon raised to her memory.
The world has no relic of Joan. Her armour, her banner, the picture of herself that she saw at Arras, have all disappeared. We possess but the record of a fair face framed in plentiful dark hair, of a strong and graceful
shape, of a sweet woman's voice. And it seems—and
yet, indeed, hardly is—a wonder that no worthy poem has been made in her honour. She is one of the few for whom poet and romancer can do little; for as there is nothing in her life that needs either to be hidden or adorned, we see her best in the clear and searching light of history.
